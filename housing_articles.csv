Sidewalk Labs' proposal for Waterfront Toronto is a brazen grab for Torontonians' land and local democracy. Unfortunately, it is an all too familiar story for those of us in other cities where Alphabet, Sidewalk's parent company, is expanding.

For the past two decades, my organization, the Partnership for Working Families, has worked to build vibrant, inclusive, equitable cities in the U.S. Increasingly, that means confronting the outsized power of big tech. Again and again, we have seen Google and its affiliates go to great lengths to subvert democratic practices in our cities. Sidewalk's over-reach in Toronto is no anomaly; it's how Alphabet does business.

Case in point: For the past two years, communities in San Jose, Calif., have been fighting for transparency and a seat at the table as Google plans a 50-acre mega campus in the middle of downtown. Instead of engaging the community, Google demanded 18 elected officials and city staff, including the mayor and multiple council members, sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs).

These agreements kept important details from the public as the tech giant negotiated a secret deal to buy some of San Jose's most valuable public land for its private campus. When community members protested at the council meeting to sell the land, police removed all members of the public from chambers and the mayor announced that the vote would proceed without us. Google's representatives were allowed to stay.

This disregard for transparency and democracy is part of a pattern. This year, our research uncovered that as Google has built offices and data centres across the U.S., it routinely went out of its way to hide information from the public. As reported in the Washington Post, the corporation's ""development spree has often been shrouded in secrecy, making it nearly impossible for some communities to know, let alone protest or debate, who is using their land, their resources and their tax dollars until after the fact.""

We found that Google has a regular practice of asking public officials to sign extremely broad NDAs, hiding its identity from both public officials and residents through the use of front companies (including during negotiations of economic benefits and public services), and even blocking residents from knowing how much public water its data centres use, claiming is a trade secret.

Alphabet's endgame is profit, and control is a recurring strategy across its business. Google siphons up our data, decides what search results we see, and dominates online search advertising. Last month, it was reported that the U.S. Congress and Department of Justice are looking into whether the corporation and other tech giants are violating antitrust law.

So we were shocked, but not surprised, to learn that when Sidewalk was invited to propose ideas for developing 12 acres of waterfront property, it instead unleashed a proposal to develop a nearly 200-acre ""IDEA district"" and named itself as a lead developer for 37 acres of that and a significant development role in all of it.

Worse, Sidewalk's proposal rejects democratic government by prescribing new and different oversight and governance for the waterfront, as one observer put it, ""pushing back the city's authority and replacing it with semiprivatized bureaucratic SWAT teams.""

But we've also seen in other cities that when working people stand together, we can protect democracy from corporate capture. In New York City, communities fought back and won when Amazon sought $3 billion of public money for a second headquarters that would steamroll the most racially diverse urban area in the world. New Yorkers were clear: They would not allow a tech behemoth to rewrite the rules of living and working in Queens to suit only the rich.

In San Jose, residents, tech service workers and even Google employees are organizing to hold Google to account and make sure families have the freedom to stay and thrive in the communities they've built. Likewise, community groups raising questions about the Sidewalk project, including the #BlockSidewalk campaign, are defending democracy.

For the rest of us, our endgame is vibrant, multiracial democracy and shared prosperity. It's not just morally right, it is what we need to face the global challenges of authoritarianism, inequality and climate disaster. We believe when Torontonians challenge Sidewalk's bid for control, they open the door to a truly inclusive and collaborative process to determine the future of their waterfront, their city and our world.

San Jose is the Bay Area's most populous city, home to more than a million people and the headquarters of eBay, TiVo and Adobe. It's a major urban hub for workers at Facebook in nearby Palo Alto and Apple in Mountain View. It is also one of the wealthiest cities in the world, where a salary of six figures only just qualifies as middle class. And yet, tourists rarely visit the city in any numbers. Compared to its northern neighbors, Oakland and San Francisco, the press barely pays it any attention, except when the Sharks make the NHL playoffs.

City officials are working hard to cast off its reputation as rich but bland, hoping that a huge new transit center in the downtown core will rethink its landscape - making it more environmentally friendly, and less dependent on cars.

This being 21st-century California, the centerpiece of their plans involves a huge new tech campus. Google is planning to bring some 20,000 employees into San Jose, on a vast new 50-acre site that will include shops, restaurants, and housing, as well as office space of up to 8m square feet, all of it accessible to public transit.

The tech giant has already spent over $380m buying sites for its development in the area since 2016, from industrial buildings to bars and restaurants. Google's ""village"" is centered around the Diridon Station regeneration project, the planned site of what would be the largest transit hub west of the Mississippi.

If all goes to plan, San Jose officials hope the city's downtown, which is currently underused, will soon look much more like a modern big-city core.

""We have the opportunity to create a vibrant urban center that Silicon Valley has long lacked,"" said San Jose's mayor, Sam Liccardo. ""Silicon Valley has developed patterns of urban sprawl for many decades. We finally have the chance to retrofit a place that was built for cars to a place that will be built for people.""

Previously, San Jose grew outward, annexing outlying communities and paving over open space. The mayor's effort is part of a shift by the city to grow taller and more dense in its core. But the changes and their impact on affordability and displacement, in one of the most diverse cities in America, have many worried.

""Clearly there's a need for density, transit-oriented development, and to get people out of their cars,"" said Jeffery Buchanan, the policy director of Silicon Valley Rising, a labor organization. ""It's a question of who is there to take advantage of this great new downtown?""

'Where do we move to?'

In Roosevelt Park, two and a half miles away from the Google site, a small encampment of tents clusters near the banks of Coyote Creek. Around a dozen people live here, in a camp that has existed in one form or another for around 30 years. ""It's a family,"" said Edwin Vazquez, as he did the rounds checking on his neighbors. During recent rains the creek's water rose a hundred feet, forcing them to move their tents to the nearby lawn.

Many of the city's homeless advocates argue that the Google project will be like the rains: raising the cost of housing and forcing San Jose's least well-off to flee to outlying parts of the Bay Area, such as Modesto or Santa Cruz. They'd like the city to make Google pay more to defray those impacts. ""To whom much is given, much is expected,"" said Scott Wagers, a minister who works with the homeless here.

""These techies move into new houses. Where do we move to?"" added homeless advocate Shaun Cartwright. Tensions have inevitably run high. Another activist, Sandy Perry, was one of eight people who chained himself to seats in the city council chambers to protest the Google deal, forcing police to remove them.

Ramon Johnson sits in a walker, his Pomeranian service dog named Navarro at his feet. Johnson, who has lived in San Jose since 1963, rented a unit in a subsidized below-market rate duplex for fifteen years near Spartan Stadium. He became homeless after the landlord evicted him to put the unit on the unrestricted market. ""It's been horrible,"" he said.

As soon as Google came a-calling, it was like a cartoon, they got dollar signs in their eyes

Although Johnson has subsequently found affordable housing on San Jose's west side, he thinks the city's leadership has not struck a strong enough deal for people like him.

""Mayor Liccardo - whom I consider a friend and helped me get housing - he and the city council lacks a vision,"" said Johnson. ""As soon as Google came a-calling, it was like a cartoon, they got dollar signs in their eyes, and it blinded them. San Jose has always been afflicted with a disease of being in the shadow of San Francisco. It's always aspired to be a big city, but it's never had big city visionaries.""

One of those who hopes to be a big city visionary is  developer Jon Dishotsky. The Palo Alto native grew up in a co-living situation of sorts: his Stanford professor father had graduate students endlessly cycling in and out of their house. The co-founder and CEO of Starcity would like to bring that same sense of community to his housing development in San Jose, a co-living building which would house 803 units in 18 stories close to Diridon Station and the Google offices.

Starcity buildings in Los Angeles and San Francisco have drawn criticism for being simply single-room occupancy buildings by another name, rebranding for the elite rather than the destitute. But Dishotsky thinks that the building will appeal to a generation of people for whom white-picket fence suburbs are financially out of reach and environmentally unsustainable.

""The obvious scapegoat is the people who are doing well,"" he said. ""I get why it sucks. I'm a working class person. I wake up, and a shining glass condo shows up, with a guy pouring champagne for his blonde wife. I'd say 'fuck you', too. Developers have done a disservice to communities for years. I get it.""

'Get as big as possible'

San Jose was once California's Pueblo Numero Uno, the name given to it by the first Spanish colonizers in 1797. (Los Angeles was Pueblo Numero Dos.) It used to be an agricultural community, housing canning industries and peach trees. That hasn't been true for many people's life-times, however, said UC Merced professor Jessica Trounstine, who grew up in the city and whose book Political Monopolies in American Cities examined its political history. ""In the 1950s, San Jose was really just coming out of its agricultural phase. It began a long trajectory of annexation. The goal was to get as big as possible,"" she said. By the 70s, a neighborhood revolt put an end to that phase of growth, leaving San Jose in the awkward position of being something of a bedroom community to the job centers in nearby cities.

The latest downtown regeneration plans would contain some of the tech industry within San Jose borders, although many of those employers are already present: Adobe, Cisco, and IBM already have offices, and Airbnb is planning an expansion as well. Google, and the surrounding projects, in Trounstine's view would be ""the tech of all tech"".

Amid its expansion plan, Google has committed to investing up to $1bn in housing throughout the Bay Area, including in San Jose. ""As we work to build a more helpful Google, we know our responsibility to help starts at home,"" Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, wrote when announcing the donation in June.

In June, Silicon Valley Rising estimated that by 2030, because of the impact of the Google expansion, the average annual rent would increase by $816 per year - $68 per month more. To offset this increase, it called for an additional 5,284 subsidized below-market rate housing units to be built and 12,450 market-rate units.

""We've engaged directly with Google throughout the process. We've yet to see Google offer the specifics,"" said SVR's Jeffrey Buchanan. He added: ""To date, Google has not been forthcoming of what it plans to do in the city of San Jose.""

In November, the group sued over the city's negotiations with Google, claiming that when city officials, including the mayor, signed nondisclosure agreements they violated state law governing official transparency. That suit is ongoing. The group also protested at the shareholder of Alphabet, Google's parent company, in June.

For Buchanan, the mayor's plans to remake the city's downtown area should not clash with his group's issues over wealth inequality. But right now, they do. Certainly transit and development are needed - the question is who wins and loses from it. And how do the winners of the multi-decade transformation of San Jose compensate the losers? As for now, that conflict remains.

""Density in the downtown is the future of San Jose,"" said Buchanan. ""As we pursue that, we have to protect our history as a working class city and protect our communities of color. These two ideas don't need to be in conflict, but it takes leadership.""

San Jose real estate developer and Opportunity Zone investor Urban Catalyst spent $2.8 million to buy a quarter-acre property on West San Carlos Street, just blocks away from the planned Google campus coming to downtown San Jose.

The investment company closed Friday on the property, which is currently home to the family-owned auto parts store Hub Cap City, and the small embroidery business Susan Kay Embroidery. The sale included a duplex, a single-family home, and an apartment attached to one of the businesses, according to the listing. It was originally listed for $2.45 million.

Urban Catalyst President Erik Hayden told the Business Journal that his company plans to bulldoze the existing buildings and begin construction on a new building in the next 12 to 18 months. He says he wants to get input from the neighborhood before deciding what to build, saying it could potentially become an office, a multifamily residential project, a hotel or a senior living facility.

""We want to get it right,"" Hayden said. ""We spend a lot of time initially going through the different possible development types and figuring out what works best.""

The property, at the corner of West San Carlos and Josepha streets, is currently zoned for a 5-story building that tops out at a maximum of 65 feet. If Urban Catalyst decides to build a residential development there, it's pre-approved for roughly 85 units, according to the listing.

The site is also about a half-mile from Diridon Station and the new urban, mixed-use campus that Alphabet Inc.'s Google plans to build there, a project that could eventually accommodate some 20,000 Googlers.

""We're big fans of the Diridon Station plan and transit-oriented development,"" Hayden said. ""Personally, I'm a big fan of West San Carlos, where I've helped develop almost 1,000 residential units.""

In earlier roles, Hayden worked on the teams that built the 218-unit luxury apartment complex Meridian at Midtown, kitty-corner to the Safeway on West San Carlos, and the Ohlone, an 8.25-acre housing development built atop the former VTA bus yard at West San Carlos and Sunol streets.

This is the second major commercial real estate deal for the Urban Catalyst Opportunity Fund I. In May, the firm spent $6.9 million to buy the Lido's Nightclub building at 30 S. First Street. Urban Catalyst plans to buy 10 to 12 more properties, largely in San Jose and Oakland, inside ""Opportunity Zones,"" a new tax designation that gives developers incentives to redevelop specific urban areas.

The Mercury News first spotted the fund's latest purchase.

Hub Cap City owner Sean Hamblin, 47, said he figured out his building was being sold when he saw surveyors walking the property and taking measurements. The business, which was previously called Mr. Hub Cap, has been at that location since 1982. Hamblin changed the name to Hub Cap City when he bought the business in 2003.

He and his next-door neighbor, Susan Kay Embroidery, are on month-to-month leases, and he says he has the next 12 to 18 months to find a new location.

""I've got to pick up and move,"" Hamblin said. ""And with the cost of moving, it's not easy. There's winners and losers in these deals, and if you're a property owner, you're a winner, and if you're just a renter trying to make it? Right now, I have no plan.""

Google's large and growing footprint in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland could soon reach more than 1 million square feet.

Commercial real estate industry company the Broderick Group provided the estimate in a recent market report and said Google is on an ""aggressive"" expansion in Kirkland.

The Broderick Group declined to break down Google's real estate portfolio, but the figure adds to expectations that the Mountain View-based search giant will occupy a large chunk of space in the Kirkland Urban development.

Google already has a 375,000-square-foot office in Kirkland. Kirkland Urban will have about 600,000 square feet of office space, although Tableau has claimed 92,000 square feet in the development.

Commercial real estate and technology industry sources told sister publication the Puget Sound Business Journal last summer that Google planned to buy the office portion of Kirkland Urban. Several weeks before, office brokers said they were told to stop taking clients on tours through the the property because Google had taken the space.

Google has not responded to a request for more information.

In addition to intensive real estate expansion in its Bay Area backyard - including around its Mountain View headquarters and planned development of a downtown San Jose campus - Google is growing aggressively in the Puget Sound area. It has with an estimated 200,000-square-foot campus in Fremont, Washington, and Vulcan is developing an estimated 929,000 square feet of space across five buildings in the South Lake Union area outside SEattle.

GoogleеКalso leased 80,000 square feetеКin the One Twelfth @ Twelfth office campus near the edge of downtown Bellevue, Washington, and plans to take more space in the city, according to commercial real estate industry sources. Finally, the company is also building an office near Marymoor ParkеКin Redmond, Washington, with room for at least 200 employees and 36,000 square feet of production and warehouse space, according to documents obtained by the Business Journal.

A1,"Costs, Approval Bighurdles For Googlein Building Homes;

Google has committed to a $1 billion plan that would help build 20,000 homes in the Bay Area over the next decade. But that round number represents the smallest of down payments on what has become the region's thorniest problem.

A new apartment in the Bay Area costs about $700,000 to build, including land and fees, said Cynthia Parker, CEO of Bridge Housing, a major nonprofit developer in San Francisco. The price tag on 20,000 units could be more than $14 billion.

That would be a major chunk of Google's cash on hand. Parent company Alphabet had $136.8 billion in revenue last year and reported $109.1 billion in reserves.

That said, the tech company's balance sheet, combined with government subsidies and other financial sources, could lead to an unprecedented amount of new housing, according to experts. But Google faces a costly and byzantine process. Approval for new homes and offices in Mountain View, San Jose and Sunnyvale will take years, according to city officials.

Google's plan includes $250 million to finance at least 5,000 units of affordable housing in the Bay Area. It did not specify sites, though Google told The Chronicle the homes would not necessarily be situated on land it already owns. Its commitment also involves getting land it owns worth $750 million rezoned for housing.

Google doesn't plan to build the housing itself, and the homes would be available for nonemployees. The company said it's already fielding interest from developers and is seeking new models around construction and financing to reduce costs.

Google also plans to buy existing affordable housing and keep rents low - similar to health care company Kaiser Permanente's $5.2 million purchase to preserve 41 units in Oakland, as part of its $100 million housing and homelessness effort. Other tech giants including Facebook, Cisco and Microsoft are directly funding affordable housing. It's a shift for companies that have focused on snapping up office space - and an indication that the housing crisis is becoming a barrier in hiring new talent.

Google's investment, however, translates to only $50,000 for each of the 5,000 units it wants to finance - a small portion of what's necessary, say affordable housing advocates.

""For $50,000 per home, what are they going to do? You can't even get the materials for that,"" said Amie Fishman, executive director of the Non-Profit Housing Association of Northern California, a policy group.

Government subsidies cover most of the funding for 100% affordable projects, which are usually reserved for renters making a fraction of the area median income. A federal program, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, is the biggest pot of money, and allows corporations like Google to fund affordable projects in exchange for a tax break. City and states also help, while the rest of the funding comes from traditional construction loans. Google could help fulfill those funding requirements.

Affordable as well as market-rate housing is getting increasingly difficult to build.

The region's construction costs are rising as demand for new buildings from the booming tech sector meets a dire shortage of labor and a spike in steel prices related to the tariff wars.

Developers can swallow those costs on projects like luxury housing and large office buildings, which command high rents, said Carol Galante, faculty director of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley. Those projects also generate fees that help pay for affordable housing. But building a new affordable home costs almost as much as market-rate housing, while below-market rents make them hard to finance.

""The challenge is that in our high-cost environment in California, the subsidy that comes from that federal tax credit is not by itself enough to afford building the same kind of product, at the same kind of costs, as a market-rate project that's charging five times more in rent,"" Galante said. ""Then, you need these other sources of local or philanthropic subsidies to 'pencil out.'""

Bridge Housing's Parker said Google could make a dent in construction by leasing land it owns to nonprofit developers for a minimal rate. Land costs account for $150,000 to $175,000 of each new unit of housing. ""The cost of land has gone up considerably in the bay and the whole West Coast,"" she said.

Judith Bell, vice president of programs at the San Francisco Foundation, wants more answers from Google: How will the dollars be deployed? Are these investments of actual dollars or loans at lower interest rates? Will Google partner with other established funds to make ends meet?

""This ends up being really complex and time-consuming work,"" said Bell, whose group supplies low-interest loans to nonprofit developers of affordable homes, in addition to its other philanthropy. ""Google could make it easier or harder depending on how it moves forward.""

Others want Google to stick to established programs.

""We don't need another loan fund. We don't need more bank partners,"" Fishman said. By investing in the federal tax credit program, Google could make a direct impact without creating more work for developers, she said.

Google's efforts coincide with its vast office expansion plans which, critics point out, will further raise demand for housing.

North of its Mountain View headquarters, Google has proposed 1.2 million square feet of new offices, or room for more than 7,000 employees at the North Bayshore area. It owns 58% of the land in the area.

Google also wants 5,700 new homes there, with 20% of them affordable - part of its 20,000-unit goal. More city approvals are required, and the first new buildings are expected to open starting in 2023.

""The city is pleased to see Google, with such a large Mountain View and Bay Area footprint, take an active role in addressing this regional challenge,"" Mountain View Mayor Lisa Matichak said in a statement.

In San Jose, Google has a project in the works near Caltrain's Diridon Station with offices for about 20,000 workers. The city previously sought 5,000 housing units in the area, with a goal of having 25% of them affordable. Google could build more than that but hasn't filed a formal proposal.

In Sunnyvale, Google has spent more than $800 million on land in the Moffett Park area and has proposed major office projects. The city is studying the land for a potential rezoning, though no conclusions have been reached. A report to the City Council is expected by early 2021, said Jennifer Garnett, a city spokeswoman.

Even if Google reaches its goals, the Bay Area still needs much more housing. The Association of Bay Area Governments, a regional planning agency, calls for 187,990 new housing units from 2015 to 2023. With four years left, only a quarter of those homes have been permitted.

""Tech companies and businesses are all stepping up to meet the urgent need,"" Fishman said. ""There are ways to do that that will maximize impact, and there are ways to do that that won't.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe downtown San Jose properties where Poor House Bistro, World of Sports, and Poor House Studio operate, along with an adjacent surface parking lot, are now owned by a development partnership led by Google.

SAN JOSE  Google has expanded the footprint for its proposed transit village in downtown San Jose  and now has spent more than $380 million buying sites for its huge development  with the purchase of the locations of a popular restaurant and a prominent memorabilia store.

The properties where Poor House Bistro, World of Sports, and Poor House Studio operate, along with an adjacent surface parking lot, are now owned by TC Agoge Associates, the development partnership of Google and real estate firm Trammell Crow.

Google is continuing to assemble the properties for what will be one of the greatest urban campuses ever built, said Mark Ritchie, president of San Jose-based Ritchie Commercial, a real estate firm.

In the most recent purchase, the Google-led venture bought four parcels, paying $15 million in cash to obtain the properties, according to public documents filed on June 27 with the Santa Clara County Recorders Office. The seller was Meduri Family Commercial Properties, the county records show.

Google is extremely serious about this development, said Bob Staedler, principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a land use and planning consultancy. They are executing a master plan they have had for some time. This is not whim or whimsy.

The addresses for the newly acquired sites are 82 S. Montgomery St., as well as 87 and 91 S. Autumn St., public records disclosed.

Googles shopping spree in San Joses urban core began in December 2016 with the $55 million purchase of an aging Pacific Bell site. Since then, Google has bought parcels beneath office buildings, industrial buildings, a public storage complex, junkyards, vacant lots, surfacing parking sites, houses, a car wash, retail sites, a defunct hardware store, metal fabricator, a restaurant, a bar, and a century-old steel foundry.

Jay Meduri, owner of Poor House Bistro, a popular New Orleans themed restaurant which opened in 2005 and operates in the familys century-old home, has said that the hot spot plans to stay open for years to come. Meduri has a lease that runs until 2021 and after that he hopes to become part of the Google campus.

We feel that Poor House Bistro would be a great addition with Google and look forward to working with them to keep the good times rolling in downtown, Meduri said.

The search giant, either directly or through the partnership with Trammell Crow, has now spent $381.7 million buying properties near the Diridon train station and the SAP Center on the western edges of downtown San Jose.

The company also has secured options or obtained purchase agreements to buy numerous additional properties.

This is a well-thought-out plan, Staedler said. This isnt a case where Google just woke up one morning and decided to do this project.

Mountain View-based Google has proposed the development of a transit-oriented community of office buildings, homes, shops, restaurants, cultural amenities, and parks where 25,000 people could work, including 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giants employees.

The footprint for the Google transit village stretches roughly one mile as the crow flies.

Google has to grow, and the people and the brainpower of the Google employees drive their success and profits, Staedler said. Those employees have to work somewhere and they have to live somewhere, and San Jose is a big part of where that growth can occur.",14,J. Jennings Moss,28-Jun-19,Poor House Location Becomes Latest Google Buy Near Diridon,387,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Poor House Location Becomes Latest Google Buy Near Diridon

One of the better known commercial outlets near Diridon Station will have a new landlord now that Google has acquired the property as part of its quest to build a huge mixed-use campus in San Jose.

Poor House Bistro, a Cajun restaurant at 91 S. Autumn St. that's been in business since 2005, was part of a four-parcel, $15 million deal reached by a partnership between Google and real estate firm Trammell Crow, according to a report Friday in the Mercury News.

That entity, TC Agoge Associates, also picked up buildings that house the World of Sports, and Poor House Studio.

In 2017, Google and the city of San Jose announced the search giant's ambitious plan to create an urban corporate campus that could span some 8 million square feet and include office space and housing along with restaurants and retail.

Google and its development ally, Trammell Crow, spent more than a year accumulating privately owned land in the area. And last November, Google and the city wrapped up negotiations that cleared the way for a $109.87 million sale of about 10.5 acres of publicly owned land around Diridon Station.

The purchase of the Poor House and adjacent properties - bordered by West San Fernando Street, South Autumn Street, South Montgomery Street and the VTA's light rail tracks - was disclosed in public documents filed Thursday, the Mercury News reported.

The seller was listed as Meduri Family Commercial Properties. According to the webpage for the Poor House, the property had been owned by the Meduri family since at least the late 1950s.

The last Meduri to live in the home was Jay Meduri, who moved into the house in 1993, staying with his family for seven years. After several trips to New Orleans, Jay Meduri decided to turn the house into a restaurant that served Cajun food and offered live jazz. Renovation on the home began in 2000 and lasted five years.

Even though Google is buying the property, Meduri told the Mercury News that the Poor House was not going away: ""We feel that Poor House Bistro would be a great addition with Google and look forward to working with them to keep the good times rolling in downtown,"" Meduri told the publication.

Adobe Inc. on Monday held a groundbreaking ceremony for its new 1.3 million-square-foot downtown San Jose office tower, marking a symbolic milestone for the Bay Area's largest city.

The glassy, 18-story tower is rising at 333 W. San Fernando St., across the street from Adobe's existing headquarters. The software maker is already downtown San Jose's largest private employer and will more than double its workforce in the city with the addition of the new building, which will be able to accommodate 4,000 additional workers.

Adobe co-founder John Warnock, who started the company in 1982 with co-founder Chuck Geschke, took the stage at the groundbreaking ceremony, explaining their decision in the early 1990s to move the company from Mountain View to San Jose. Despite being the Bay Area's largest city, San Jose is still working to shake its reputation as a bedroom community for the rest of Silicon Valley.

""We worked very closely with (former San Jose Mayor) Tom McEnery and later with Susan Hammer, and the city of San Jose was the most welcoming city that we were able to deal with,"" Warnock said at the event.

These days, Adobe is a Fortune 500 company with 21,000 employees worldwide and a market value of close to $150 billion. ""It was John and Chuck's vision that put Adobe on the map in the business world, but actually it was also John and Chuck's vision that put Adobe on the map in San Jose,"" Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said at the event.

That decision by Adobe 25 years ago to plant itself in downtown San Jose was visionary, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said.

""I know it's not obvious to us now as we see tech expanding in urban centers, but certainly in the 1990s that wasn't the pattern,"" Liccardo said. ""We saw largely the corporate equivalent of gated communities in suburban parts of our Valley. And that's the way Silicon Valley operated, with tilt-up buildings surrounded by a sea of parking. And John and Chuck had a different vision and that was the vision for an urban campus.""

A glassy pedestrian skybridge will connect the new building to Adobe's existing three-tower headquarters, which is bounded by Park Avenue, Almaden Boulevard, West San Fernando Street and the Guadalupe River Trail and Highway 87. The new tower will be all-electric and, like Adobe's existing campus, be LEED certified for environmental standards, company executives said at the event.

Adobe purchased the already-entitled 2.5-acre site for its new tower for $68 million in early 2018 from Bay Area investors and developers John and Phil DiNapoli and Lew Wolff.

""We outgrew our campus and we couldn't pull the trigger fast enough on a new building,"" Scott Ekman, Adobe's senior director of global real estate, explained at a Silicon Valley Business Journal event in January. ""Now we are ready to roll.""

The company expects construction to wrap up by 2022. San Mateo-based Sares Regis Group of Northern California is the development manager for the project. The company has in the past worked on the Silicon Valley corporate headquarters for Electronic Arts, Nvidia, Symantec Corp. and others.

Milpitas-based Devcon Construction is the general contractor for Adobe's new tower and Gensler is the architecture firm.

The new tower's construction comes amid a city-wide building boom that has generated more than 120 major development projects in San Jose.

Along with the dozens of formal developments that have sprung up downtown, search giant Google is also moving ahead with still-nascent plans for a large transit-oriented mixed-use campus around San Jose's Diridon station that could eventually accommodate 20,000 workers. At the same time, homegrown San Jose companies like video conferencing startup Zoom Inc. have gone public and soared to multibillion-dollar valuations.

""We now have more than 180 tech companies here in downtown San Jose,"" Liccardo said. ""Who would've thought that would've been possible a decade ago or two decades ago for that matter? And now we have a wonderful billion-dollar companies - Zoom, Okta and many others - that are here in downtown and a couple of other companies you've probably heard of that have some big plans here. It all happened because Adobe decided we're going to do it first.""

Elsewhere in the Bay Area, Adobe has expanded its lease in San Francisco at 100 Hooper St. and in the East Bay in Emeryville.

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe Bay Area gained 10,300 jobs in May, which means the nine-county region produced a stunning 53 percent of the jobs that were added statewide.

Bay Area employment surged to record highs in May, with the nine-county region producing more than half of the jobs created in California last month, state labor officials reported Friday.

There is no doubt about it, the Bay Area is punching way above its weight, said Christopher Thornberg, an economist and a founding partner with Beacon Economics.

The gains during May were powered primarily by big upswings in the South Bay, which added 3,300 positions, and the San Francisco-San Mateo region, which gained 7,500 jobs, the Employment Development Department reported. The East Bay added 500 jobs. All the numbers were adjusted for seasonal variations.

California added 19,400 jobs during May, the EDD report showed. The Bay Area gained 10,300 jobs that month, which means the region produced a stunning 53 percent of the jobs that were added statewide.

The statewide jobless rate improved to 4.2 percent last month, lower than the 4.3 percent unemployment levels of April.

The job growth in the Bay Area is unprecedented, said Michael Bernick, a fellow with the Milken Institute and a former EDD director.

Whats more, the Bay Areas dominance of Californias employment scene is far from a one-time event, this news organizations analysis of state data shows.

Over the one-year period that ended in May, California gained 282,700 jobs, while the Bay Area added 100,900 positions, EDD reports show.

This means that the Bay Area, despite having just 19 percent of Californias population, muscled up to generate 36 percent of all the jobs added statewide over the 12-month stretch.

Technology companies extended a head-spinning hiring spree in the Bay Area during May, according to an analysis of the EDD report that Beacon Economics and UC Riverside provided to this news organization.

The growth of the job market affirms that people want to work in the Bay Area and that tech companies want to expand here, said Stephen Levy, director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy.

The technology industry added 2,500 jobs in the South Bay, 1,800 jobs in the San Francisco-San Mateo metro region and 1,100 in the East Bay, the Beacon Economics assessment determined.

Through a dazzling combination of property purchases and leases, Google, Apple, and Facebook have launched a dramatic expansion of their Bay Area operations, adding millions of square feet of offices. Amazon has created a beachhead of a million square feet of leased office space in Sunnyvale. LinkedIn is seeking a bigger Mountain View headquarters campus. Upstarts such as Uber and Square have widened their footprints. Adobe is about to embark on a new office tower for its headquarters campus in downtown San Jose.

Despite the challenges of a lack of housing, tech companies still are able to find employees in the Bay Area, Levy said.

Still, nontech sectors showed plenty of strength in the three largest Bay Area metro regions that all boast at least one million jobs: the South Bay, East Bay and San Francisco-San Mateo area, the Beacon analysis determined.

During May, the East Bay added 1,100 administrative support jobs  primarily clerical workers  as well as another 700 construction jobs. The San Francisco-San Mateo region gained 2,400 hotel and restaurant jobs, 2,000 construction positions and 1,000 finance and insurance jobs. The South Bay added 700 health care jobs.

The Bay Area now has 4.08 million nonfarm payroll jobs, which is an all-time high, the EDDs seasonal adjusted figures show. This region first reached the extraordinary milestone of 4 million jobs in August 2018.

Experts, nevertheless, remain concerned about whether the Bay Area can sustain its remarkable expansion, raising questions about whether the area can produce enough housing to accommodate the employment boom.

For the better part of a decade, the Bay Area has fallen far short of creating housing units to keep up with the job growth, according to statistics from the Building Industry Association and Construction Industry Research Board.

From 2010 through 2018, the Bay Area gained roughly 882,000 jobs, EDD figures show. Over the same stretch of years, the nine-county region produced a relatively puny 177,000 new residential units, measured by building permits issued in the area.

That is an average shortfall of 78,000 units a year during that period.

Still, in recent years, the situation appears to have gradually improved, and the gap has narrowed, this news organizations analysis of the EDD and construction industry figures shows.

After a shortfall of 120,000 housing units produced compared to the number of jobs created during 2015, the gap began shrinking in the succeeding years.

The chasm between homes produced compared with jobs created shrank to a gap of 85,000 in 2016, 53,000 in 2017 and to 49,000 in 2018.

In a very real sense, housing means more jobs, Thornberg said.

Absent outside economic forces that could chill the Bay Area job market, the current upswing could well persist throughout this year and during 2020, experts said.

Without some external event, the employment growth in the Bay Area could well continue for a while, Bernick said.",21,Levi Sumagaysay The Mercury News,21-Jun-19,Google Shoots Down Shareholder Proposals;,480,"The Free Lance-star (fredericksburg, Va)",Main; Pg. 11a,"Google Shoots Down Shareholder Proposals;

More than a dozen shareholder proposals failed as expected at Google's annual meeting Wednesday, but they raised important questions about the massive company, which has had its share of scandals and controversy over the past year or so.

From ethical questions raised by Google products and contracts to the company's handling of sexual harassment and treatment of contract workers, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Chairman John Hennessy and other executives got an earful from disgruntled investors, advocacy groups and employees at the meeting in Sunnyvale while protesters marched outside.

Among the defeated proposals was one that sought a breakup of the company. The presenter of the proposal, a representative of Students for a Free Tibet, urged the company to take steps now ""rather than waiting for antitrust regulators to act."" As the internet giant faces possible U.S. antitrust inquiries and calls to break it up, she said the company has ""grown to a complexity that is unmanageable.""

Another proposal that failed urged the company to study and share an assessment of the human rights implications of Project Dragonfly, Google's reported plan to once again operate a search engine in China.

""As we've said, we have no plans to open a search engine in China,"" said Kent Walker, senior vice president for global affairs and chief legal officer for Google, during the meeting's Q&A session. CEO Sundar Pichai said in a New York Times interview in November, after employees protested-and quit-over the issue, ""It's not even clear to me that search in China is the product we need to do today.""

There were more than a few mentions of recent employee protests and actions during the meeting, including one in November when thousands of workers walked off the job in response to a report of huge payouts to executives accused of sexual misconduct and harassment. A proposal for a clawback policy, in which an executive would be forced to pay the company back in case of misconduct, did not pass, either.

After the proposal to install a non-executive employee representative on the board of directors failed, a Google employee said during the Q&A: ""What's really stuck out to me recently is this shift when we're challenged,"" she said. ""I've seen executives feign powerlessness as if we're not a company the size of some countries. We're told we can't take dramatic action. When we respond this way it's disingenuous. We're choosing to use our power to solve the wrong problems, and we can do better.""

Yolanda Chavez, who spoke at the meeting as a representative of Silicon Valley Rising, expressed concerns about Google's plan for a giant campus in San Jose.

""Yesterday's announcement [a $1 billion pledge by the company to help with Bay Area housing] was a positive sign that Google is listening to the community,"" she said through a translator.

San Jose's iconic Stephen's Meat Products sign - long a fixture near Diridon Station in San Jose - has undergone a complete renovation and was lit up in a ceremony Thursday night.

The sign marked the location for the meat market that was built in 1948, though the company had been founded in 1942.

The building and lot on Montgomery Street was purchased by the now-defunct San Jose Development Agency in 2005 with the idea that the area would be the home for a new Oakland A's ballpark. When that didn't happen, the building was torn down in 2007 though the sign remained and a parking lot took the place of the market.

Renewed questions about what would happen to the sign began to surface after Google and the city of San Jose announced in 2017 that the search giant wanted to build a massive mixed-use campus around the transit center, which would include the Stephen's Meat Products parking lot.

The sign was fully renovated by Kevin Chong of Silica Valley Glass in San Jose, who did did the repair work along with Yesco, a Salt Lake City-based sign company.

Andre Luthard, board president of the Preservation Action Council of San Jose (PAC SJ), said Thursday at the ceremonial sign lighting that the term ""meet me at the pig"" will be a rallying cry when the Google campus gets built.

Alphabet's Google says it will commit $US1 billion ($1.46bn) to boost housing construction in the San Francisco Bay Area, the latest in a series of commitments by tech companies to address an -affordability crisis in the region.

Google chief executive Sundar Pichai announced the moves on Tuesday in a blog post in which he said the commitment would include the repurposing of $US750 million of company-owned land from commercial to residential use on which an estimated 15,000 units would be built, across all income levels.

Google will also create a $US250m fund for loans and other types of financing. The funds will go to developers to help them preserve affordable housing and build new homes, including at least 5000 new below-market-rate units.

""As we work to build a more helpful Google, we know our responsibility to help starts at home,"" Mr Pichai wrote. The company would also give $US50m through its charitable arm, Google.org, to non-profits working to address homelessness and displacement, he said.

The world's biggest technology companies are facing pressure to turn their attention to their home towns on the US west coast, where a tech-driven jobs boom has strained a housing market already short on supply. Rising rents around tech hubs from Seattle to Silicon Valley have pushed out low to middle-income workers from once affordable neighbourhoods, fuelling poverty, inequality and widespread homelessness.

Cities and states struggling to stem these issues have increasingly turned to the tech industry for help. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom, who praised Google's announcement, has specifically called on Silicon Valley to invest in helping address the state's housing shortage, which he estimates at 3.5 million homes.

Google's new housing play comes as the company grows its footprint in the region. It is building a new campus in its home town of Mountain View, which extracted a commitment from the company to build affordable housing as part of its expansion. Google is also in talks with San Jose for a potential new campus that would bring 20,000 employees to the city. Housing and displacement have been flashpoints for local communities there.

Critics say these investments don't go far enough. Jeffrey Buchanan, director of public policy at Working Partnerships USA, a non-profit focused on inequality, said: ""There is clearly still more it needs to do, but it's a very welcome first step towards fully addressing its impact on rent hikes, evictions and overcrowding."" According to a study the group commissioned, the city of San Jose alone would need more than 17,650 new homes to offset rent increases expected from new demand for housing as Google builds out in the city.

The industry at large has taken note. In January, a group of Bay Area companies and philanthropists including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg raised $US260m to help build at least 8000 homes in the region, part of what they envision as a $US500m fund for affordable housing. A separate fund seeded by LinkedIn, the Cisco Foundation and other tech philanthropists has raised $US62m.

In the Seattle area, Microsoft in January pledged $US500m to support affordable housing, $US475m for construction loans and $US25m in grants to address homelessness.Also, Microsoft and Amazon.com last week gave $US5m each to a Seattle non-profit that operates housing and support services for the homeless.",24,,20-Jun-19,Google Antes Up;,371,The San Francisco Chronicle (california),Op-ed; Editorials; Pg. A11,"Google Antes Up;

Whether it's enlightened self interest or flat recognition of the housing crisis, Google's pledge to create 20,000 homes is nothing to ignore. The tech giant has the money, land and motivation to deliver in meeting a major challenge.

The firm is promising a mix of units spread across its holdings in the South Bay, regularly cited as one of the costliest residential markets in the nation. Google has run into criticism that a new campus in San Jose will drive up rents even further.

Other entities such as Wells Fargo and Kaiser along with the Facebook-backed Partnership for the Bay Area's Future are pouring nine-figure sums into moderate-priced housing. It's a late blooming realization that soaring job growth comes with inescapable side effects. The big winners, especially in tech, have a role to play.

The Google plan calls for $750 million to create 15,000 units across the income scale over 10 years. Another $250 million would be available for private developers to build their own projects tailored for moderate incomes. Compare Google's studied proposal with the approach Amazon took in pressing for concessions in locating a second headquarters.

Along with the size of Google's and other housing initiatives will be the timing. It can't happen fast enough.

As Google CEO Sundar Pichai noted, the 2,000 units per year pace that his firm is outlining compares with 3,000 dwellings built last year in Silicon Valley. He also rightly acknowledged where the need lies: moderate- and low-income housing that's squeezed out by roaring development.

Both the state and cities such as San Francisco are putting money into new housing plans. But those efforts aren't enough. Huge firms such as Google should be willing to play a part both for their own workforce and the larger communities where they're located.

Google's blueprints are receiving warm words, most notably from local groups worried about the persistent pressure on scarce housing. Such corporate contributions to the housing challenge are a trend to welcome and encourage.

Mountain View-based search giant Google Inc. made splashy headlines this week with its promise to commit $1 billion worth of land, investments and grants toward new housing in the Bay Area.

But the company's announcement, made by CEO Sundar Pichai, was short on details, and prompted questions Wednesday from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-San Francisco), who wrote a letter addressed to Pichai seeking clarification around where the new homes would be built, who owns the land currently, and whether Google had specific goals in mind for its grants.

Here are three big unanswered questions that remain around Google's proposal:

It's still unclear if the Internet juggernaut was simply trotting out its North Bayshore redevelopment proposal - something that's been slowly winding its way through Mountain View's political process for years -еКor whether this week's announcement represented a fresh set of new projects and future real estate purchases.

The company has in recent years purchased and leased billions of dollars of commercial real estate throughout the Bay Area, from San Francisco throughout Silicon Valley.

In her letter, Feinstein asked: ""Specifically, I would like to know whether or not Google will use existing land it owns or if [will] buy up additional commercial or industrial space.""

She continued: ""Does Google intend to coordinate with local officials in identifying land parcels to purchase?""

In his proposal, Pichai said Google plans to ""repurpose"" at least $750 million worth of land currently zoned for office or commercial space over the next decade, resulting in some 15,000 new housing units.

""In Mountain View, we've already worked with the city to change zoning in the North Bayshore area to free up land for housing, and we're currently in productive conversations with Sunnyvale and San Jose,"" Pichai wrote.

Google has spent years negotiating with Mountain View city officials about redeveloping much of its sprawling campus east of Highway 101. The company envisions replacing its existing stock of aging, low-rise office buildings and parking lots with a new, high-density neighborhood with around 10,000 new housing units, where Google employees could walk or bike to work.

The new housing likely won't resemble a traditional suburban neighborhood, but instead look more like San Jose's Santana RowеК- walkable boulevards with ground-floor retail shops and restaurants, high-rise residential buildings that stretch as high as 160 feet each, mingled with new Google office buildings, according to a company plan published in November.

In its November proposal, Google suggested earmarking 20 percent of those housing units for low-income and middle-income families, with about 70 percent of the units being rentals. That project hit a political roadblock in February, after Mountain View City Council members told Google to work with another commercial landowner in the neighborhood to come back with a unified development proposal for the entire district.

In San Jose, Google has purchased hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate in the city core to assemble a site for a planned urban campus oriented around the Diridon transit station that could eventually accommodate up to 20,000 workers.

Additionally, Google said this week that it would invest $250 million in Bay Area real estate projects that supported low-income housing. It also earmarked $50 million in grants for organizations tackling homelessness and housing displacement.

""With respect to Google's generous donation to homelessness efforts, is there a particular approach that Google is interested in investing in - such as navigation centers or broader efforts to focus on comprehensive, supportive centers?"" Feinstein asked.

Southern California News Group on poll suggesting warning signs for California Democrats' agenda:

California is a one-party state where Democrats have supermajorities in the Legislature and control every state constitutional office, but a new statewide poll by a well-respected research institute offers some potential warning signs for state Democratic officials.

Despite newly elected Gov. Gavin Newsom's landslide victory in November, he only receives a 45% approval rating among adults. That's far better than Californians' rating of President Donald Trump (34, but it's a lackluster number nevertheless.

State lawmakers' reputations fared worse. The Public Policy Institute of California survey pinned the Legislature's overall support at 39% among all adults. That, too, is higher than Californians' public support for how Congress is handling its job (30. It's typical for voters to think poorly of legislative bodies even if they really like their own representative, but the low numbers should better inform lawmakers' approach to issues.

For instance, the Legislature recently killed Senate Bill 50, a controversial measure that would have let the state pre-empt local zoning ordinances to promote the construction of high-density housing. But Californians polled by PPIC endorse that general concept: ""62 percent favor requiring local governments to change zoning for new development from single-family to multi-family housing near transit and job centers,"" according to the poll.

The poll offered another warning sign for Newsom: Only 28% of likely voters approve of the way he's handling the issues regarding last year's wildfires and the bankruptcy of PG&E. This complex issue understandably is vexing to most people surveyed. Thirty-seven percent of likely voters don't know enough to have an opinion, but 78% of adult Californians ""say they are concerned about rising electricity bills"" as a result of wildfire costs.

Californians clearly are worried about the high cost of living, which is driving not only their support for looser housing regulations but affecting their outlook about the economy and their personal finances. PPIC terms Californians' financial outlook as mixed, ""with 44 percent of adults saying we will have good times financially in California in the next 12 months and 47 percent saying we will have bad times.""

But that average obscures a wide gap. Californians' view of their economic future varies widely by geographic region. Nearly half of San Francisco Bay Area residents are financially optimistic, while only 39% of Inland Empire residents (40% in the Central Valley) have such sunny views. Residents in Orange County/San Diego and the Los Angeles area are in between (44% and 46%, respectively).

Not surprisingly, Californians with lower incomes are less optimistic about their personal finances than those with higher incomes, with Inland Empire residents viewing their personal-financial situations most negatively. Newsom and lawmakers need to pay careful attention to such disparities. Republicans have long criticized California Democrats for emphasizing progressive politics that play well in tony San Francisco Bay Area communities, while downplaying bread-and-butter economic issues that are of particular concern in rural and exurban regions.

The survey also reminds us that while the state's Democrats at no risk of losing their political power anytime soon, they're well-advised to pay more attention to the less-rosy views many Californians provided. The governor and legislators might find that their legislative priorities are not as popular as they believe them to be.

The Press Democrat on adopting a management plan for the Russian River:

Here's a safe prediction: Generations to come will be thankful for everything done today to protect the Russian River.

Here's another: Restoring and preserving the river's health will become more challenging and expensive each time action is delayed.

As reported in The Press Democrat by Staff Writer Mary Callahan, delay has been a central feature of the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board's efforts to adopt a plan to protect and improve the Russian River's water quality. The delay so far has been excusable - earlier drafts of the plan needed refinements, and California's water quality regulations have changed - but now it's time to move forward.

The third iteration since 2015 of the regional water board's staff report and draft action plan for the Russian River are now out for review and comment. Public comments will be accepted through June 24 by email at NorthCoast@waterboards.ca.gov or by writing to the Regional Water Quality Control Board at 5550 Skyline Blvd., Santa Rosa, 95403.

The board hopes to adopt the plan after a public hearing at its Aug. 14-15 meeting in Santa Rosa. The federal Clean Water Act requires states to prepare water quality protection plans, and state regulations adopted last year are designed to protect the public against waterborne bacteria from human and animal waste. The plan now under review is intended to comply with those requirements.

From its headwaters in Mendocino County to its mouth on the Sonoma County coast, the Russian River provides drinking water to 600,000 people and recreation for several times that number. Those and other uses are threatened by pollution from a variety of sources, ranging from riverfront development to streamside homeless encampments.

Since the start of its planning effort four years ago, the regional water board has heard plenty from those whose interests may be affected by such regulations as mandatory septic system upgrades or limits on runoff from livestock operations. These responses have resulted in a more tightly focused document, as detailed in the regional water board's summary of plan revisions, that is likely to be both more effective and less intrusive.

But it's important that the board hear from the general public as well. The Russian River courses through the very heart of the economy, environment and quality of life for everyone in its 1,484-square-mile watershed.

In the dry language of water regulation, the river is considered ""impaired"" by ""human-specific contaminants"" in many of its reaches. The impairment can become so severe that stretches of the river are closed to swimmers, as occurred two summers ago at Monte Rio Beach.

Pollution can be traced to sources large and small, but the biggest problems include the 19,000 parcels of land in the Russian River watershed that lack sewer connections. Some have failing septic systems. A sound plan can guide the region in identifying the worst threats to water quality, setting priorities for improvement and finding sources of financial assistance.

Protecting the Russian River's water quality may be costly, but a failure to act would ultimately be much more expensive and disruptive. The regional water board needs to know that the public supports - indeed, demands - a clean and healthy Russian River.

San Francisco Chronicle on Bay Area housing trends:

This spring, Bay Area housing prices flattened out for two months in a row. After years of heady, month-over-month price appreciations and rental spikes, this rare break created an opportunity for price-exhausted communities to take a closer look at the trends of our local housing crisis.

Sadly, those trends are as grim as they ever were.

On Thursday, Curbed SF released the results of its compilation of five years' worth of reported median rents in San Francisco from five rental platforms. It found that San Francisco's median rent on all of them reached its highest-ever height at some point in 2019.

On Zumper, a platform that also tracks national rents, the most recent median rent in San Francisco - $3,700 a month for a one-bedroom apartment in June - is the highest it's ever recorded for any city in the country.

The results varied for each site, and no single source represents a full picture of San Francisco's market rental prices.

Still, the overall trend was both clear and stark: Rent has never been higher in San Francisco, and it's going to take a lot more than a couple of months of flat prices for the Bay Area to dig out of this historic housing crisis.

It's going to take courage, vision and a keen understanding of how the region reconfigures its balance between housing and jobs.

On the latter, there are deep concerns brewing in San Jose after a new economic analysis this week showed that Google's proposed expansion in downtown San Jose could cost that city's renters an additional $235 million in higher rents every year without a significant increase in both affordable and market-rate housing production.

The analysis, conducted by Beacon Economics on behalf of a San Jose nonprofit, Working Partnerships USA, found that Google and San Jose would need to subsidize 5,284 affordable housing units and help produce 12,450 market-rate units to prevent these dramatic rent hikes.

What adds to the depressing nature of this report is the fact that San Jose voters recently rejected a $450 million affordable-housing bond.

City officials have said that San Jose provided housing for the rest of the region while other cities, particularly on the Peninsula, attracted corporate campuses without building their fair share of homes. This claim has merit.

Unfortunately, we now need every city in the region to focus on home-building, and there are still too few that are willing to do so.

For this week's example, we need look no further than Berkeley.

UC Berkeley has been trying to build two new buildings for classrooms and housing on its campus. In exchange for this perfectly sensible and badly needed project, it was sued by a neighborhood group on Wednesday.

The group's contentions read like a ""Greatest Hits"" NIMBY compilation: neighborhood character, supposed California Environmental Quality Act violations, the terror of increased trash and noise.

But the unoriginality of their gripes shouldn't detract from the very real problems this behavior has brought to the Bay Area - this crisis affects us all, and no local governments are fighting hard enough to make a difference for their increasingly stressed residents.

Small wonder the last two months of ""flat prices"" haven't felt like a reprieve.",27,Emily Mibach Daily Post Staff Writer,19-Jun-19,Google: $1 Billion For Housing;,473,"Daily Post (palo Alto, California)",News; Pg. 1,"Google: $1 Billion For Housing;

Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced yesterday that the company plans to invest $1 billion in housing, most of which is planned in Mountain View, Sunnyvale, San Francisco and San Jose.

Google‰ЫЄs announcement follows criticism from housing advocates and city leaders who have said that tech companies haven‰ЫЄt done enough to house all of the people they‰ЫЄve added to the local work force. Employees of companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple are generally well-paid, allowing them to outbid others for housing. As a result, rents have soared and many long-time local residents have lost their homes.

Google is proposing to repurpose $750 million of its land for housing, which would accommodate 15,000 new homes at all income levels.

It was unknown whether those 15,000 new homes would include the 5,760 homes already planned as part of Google‰ЫЄs Gateway site in the North Bayshore neighborhood of Mountain View.

Since Google already has an application in with the city, the company may be able to add housing to the project, but spokesman Michael Appel said that expansion of housing would have to be worked out between Google and the city.

The company plans to put $250 million into an investment fund to incentivize developers to build a minimum of 5,000 affordable housing units.

In total, Google hopes to get 20,000 homes with its $1 billion ‰ЫУ 15,000 on the land it owns and 5,000 built by developers on other properties.

Google, based in Mountain View, owns large swaths of land throughout the Bay Area, but Appel said yesterday that the focus will be on adding homes in Sunnyvale, Mountain View, San Francisco and San Jose.

Google‰ЫЄs Palo Alto properties

Google also owns land in south Palo Alto. In December, Google paid $70 million to buy 4.6 acres at 3850 Fabian Way, not far from the Oshman Family JCC. In 2016, Google bought the former headquarters of Essex Property Trust at 935 East Meadow Circle for $18 million.

In 2013, Google bought a group of buildings on the 1000 block of East Meadow Circle for $60 million. This purchase came shortly after Google paid $1 billion for a 12-building office park in Mountain View.

This announcement from Google comes on the heels of a report that came out last week from a San Jose-based nonprofit Working Partnerships USA, condemning Google ‰ЫЄs plans for its San Jose campus. The report said the city and Google needs to build 12,450 market rate apartments and 5,284 subsidized homes in order to make up for the 15,000 to 20,000 workers that will come to downtown San Jose as a result of the campus.

The group‰ЫЄs director of public policy Jeffrey Buchanan issued a statement Tuesday saying it is ‰ЫПencouraging to see Google taking the concerns of local communities seriously by recognizing some responsibility for its role in our region‰ЫЄs housing crisis.‰Ыќ

HIGHLIGHT:еКA new proposal for Rail Yard Place envisions a project on Ryland Street that would consist of 150,000 square feet of office space and 500 residential units, according to documents on file with the San Jose Planning Department.

SAN JOSE  A buyer has emerged for the Rail Yard Place project thats been proposed for downtown San Jose, a mixed-use complex of offices and homes that will serve as a key gateway to the citys urban core.

The new proposal envisions a project on Ryland Street that would consist of 150,000 square feet of office space and 500 residential units, according to documents on file with the San Jose Planning Department.

We have a buyer for the property, said Dennis Randall, a Bay Area developer who is a partner with John Pringle, another local developer, at Insight Realty, which now owns the choice 10-acre site. We have Rail Yard Place under contract.

The buyer is an affiliate of SummerHill Apartment Communities, which itself is a unit of Summerhill Housing Group, a major residential developer, according to information in city planning documents.

Summerhill would develop both the apartment portion of the project as well as the office building, according to Randall.

The terms of the purchase contract, including the timing and conditions to complete the transaction, werent disclosed.

The complex, perched next to State Route 87 and a short distance from the Guadalupe River and Diridon train station, is consideredеК a crucial project that would greet visitors to downtown San Jose.

This is a premier location in San Jose, Randall said. Its going to be the gateway to that part of downtown San Jose. When you come into the downtown from Highway 87, this will be the first project you see.

The office building is expected to be five stories high and will include four levels of underground parking, the city planning documents show.

The apartment component of Rail Yard Place is expected to consist of multi-family rental units.

Development activity in this part of downtown San Jose has intensified since early 2017 when it became apparent that Google intended to develop a transit village near the Diridon train station consisting of offices, homes, restaurants, and retail where 25,000 would work, including 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giants employees.

Googles development proposal has sparked interest on a widening number of fronts in the western edges of downtown San Jose.

The downtown core is getting extended, said Bob Staedler, principal executive with San Jose-based Silicon Valley Synergy, a planning consultancy. That allows for sites that have been long vacant to be thought of as places for mixed-use development.

Santa Clara County government agencies have leased three large office buildings nearby. Plus, Boston Properties, TMG Partners, and Valley Oak Partners have begun to clear the site for a million-square-foot tech campus of modern office buildings.

And next to all of this activity, Google has collected numerous properties for its anticipated transit village complex.

An urban village with more jobs and housing makes sense at this location, Staedler said. There is a need for both offices and residential uses here.

Downtown San Jose has begun to turn the corner and is poised to experience wide-ranging development projects and tech company expansions in the city center. But it isnt quite there yet, Randall said.

We are on the verge of greatness in downtown San Jose, Randall said. But its not great yet.",31,"Rachel Sandler, Forbes Staff",19-Jun-19,Google Says It Will Invest $1 Billion To Help The Housing Crisis.

HIGHLIGHT:еКIn total, Google says it will help build 20,000 homes in the San Francisco Bay Area over the next 10 years.

Topline: Google pledged $1 billion to build more housing in the San Francisco Bay Area, including 15,000 units on its own land and 5,000 additional affordable units throughout the region over the next decade. But housing in the region is notoriously difficult to build, and Google faces an uphill battle to square away all of the zoning requirements needed to pull off Google s housing plan, land use experts toldForbes.

еб    Over the last few years, Google has spent billions to snap up land to accommodate its 45,000 employees in the region. On Monday, CEO Sundar Pichai said in a blog post that $750 million worth of that land will be used to develop 15,000 homes.

еб    Google will spend an additional $250 million on an investment fund to provide incentives for developers to build 5,000 subsidized housing units across the Bay Area on land the company doesn t own.

еб    Additionally, the company s non-profit arm will dole out $50 million in grants to organizations focused on the issues of homelessness and displacement.

While Google itself owns the land it plans to develop on, much of the land is zoned for light industrial or office use. Before the company moves forward, it ll have to convince each city to rezone the property for residential housing. That s in addition to the myriad bureaucratic hoops and obstacles that developers face during the building process

Google, for example, has already proposed a massive housing and office complex in the North Bayshore area of Mountain View, but the project is currently onhold as the city attempts to settle infighting between Google and the developer that owns part of the land.

Working with cities may be a tough task, land use consultants toldForbes. Offices bring in more tax revenue for cities, so there s an incentive to keep land zoned for commercial use because it s more profitable.

The city would take loss of tax dollars into account,  said Norman Matteoni, a property use lawyer in San Jose.  It has to balance it against whether it will increase the tax base of the city to sustain itself. I think Google is sending a message that it can t fulfill what it wants to when it comes to office development in San Jose without housing for their employees too.

Typically, it takes three to five years to get property rezoned, said Kelly Snider, a San Francisco area land use consultant.

In general, it ll be really hard. It s been really hard for everyone else to get property rezoned. To take it out of commercial use and put it into residential use is something that is seen as undesirable for fiscal managers of cities, Snider said.

Plus, there s also an underlying resistance by some elected officials, who ultimately have control over zoning laws, to the very idea of building more housing, even as they acknowledge the region is experiencing a housing crisis.

Both mayors Sam Liccardo of San Jose and Lisa Matichak of Mountain View said in statements they are pleased with Google s commitment and look forward to working with the company, although Google hasn t submitted any specifics yet. A spokesperson for the city of Sunnyvale did not respond to a request for comment fromForbes.

Google already owns some properties zoned for housing, which will be the easiest areas to start construction in, Snider said. In downtown San Jose, for example, city officials have already been planning for increased housing around the expansion of BART, the Bay Area s mass transit line, into the city. And Google has already bought a tract of land in the city for a campus accommodating up to 20,000 jobs.

Where will these housing units be built? Possibilities include Mountain View, San Francisco, Sunnyvale and San Jose, where Google owns land.

What will these houses look like? Google will help build both apartments for rent and homes for sale, but a spokesperson said most will be apartments and multi-family residences.

How many units will be affordable? Google is pledging 5,000 affordable units through its investment fund. For the rest of the units on Google s land, a spokesperson said it will build the legally mandated percentage of affordable units per housing complex. By law, some Bay Area cities require all complexes include a percentage of affordable units, and developers can either build them or pay a fee to the city.

Activists say more needs to be done:As the region grapples with an imbalance between the number of jobs created, in part by large tech companies like Google, and the number of houses built, activists say that Google s pledge is a good first step to addressing the housing crisis, which will need more than what Google is proposing to finally solve, activists say.

It s encouraging to see Google responding to the organizing of local communities and taking seriously their impact on rising rents and displacement experienced by so many working families in our region s housing crisis,  said Jeffrey Buchanan, director of public policy at Working Partnerships,

Google is pledging to invest $1 billion to develop housing in and around Silicon Valley, where the success of the search giant and its competitors has contributed to soaring home prices.

Over the next decade, the company plans to lease to developers $750 million worth of land it owns in the San Francisco Bay Area to be developed into at least 15,000 new homes.

""As we work to build a more helpful Google, we know our responsibility to help starts at home,"" Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said in a blog post Tuesday. ""For us, that means being a good neighbor in the place where it all began over 20 years ago: the San Francisco Bay Area.""

Adding homes will increase supply, but it won't fix the region's problem. Cities have long failed to allow enough housing to be built to meet the demand created by a rush of workers entering the area.

""If [Google] were to build five times that amount -- 100,000 units over the next decade -- it probably still wouldn't solve the housing crisis,"" said Jesse Gundersheim, CoStar Group's director of market analytics for the San Francisco Bay Area.

The Bay Area has changed rapidly since Google was a start-up, founded in 1998 -- as the dot-com boom heated up -- by two graduate students at Stanford University. The company has grown into a tech behemoth that employs 45,000 people in the Bay Area, with about half working at its headquarters and offices in Mountain View.

Average apartment rents in Mountain View have doubled since then, to $3,068 a month, according to CoStar Group. Home prices have jumped as well; since early 2015, the median sales price is up nearly 50% to $1.47 million, according to Zillow. The prices put homeownership out of reach even for some tech workers.

The amount of housing has also not grown sharply enough to meet demand as tech companies have hired rapidly, pushing some employees to live far from work, resulting in long commutes that cause heavy traffic congestion. Meanwhile, lower-income workers or retirees are priced out of their longtime homes and have resorted to living in their cars or cramming their families into RVs parked on the street.

Alphabet Inc.-owned Google is ""becoming a better neighbor by taking responsibility on building workforce housing on their own sites,"" said John McAlister, a Mountain View city councilman. ""They need to be building the workforce housing because of all the unintended consequences of their growth in the area.""

Bay Area cities that long welcomed tech titans -- and tolerated the burdensome effects of their growth -- have become increasingly concerned.

Mountain View recently pushed back: Last year, voters there decided to tax businesses based on their size and how many people the firms employ in the city. Google, as Mountain View's largest private employer, is hit hardest by the tax and is estimated to pay more than $3 million annually. Most of those funds are expected to go toward transportation-related efforts.

""It would be nice for them to think outside the Bay Area to expand to lessen the impact of their success,"" McAlister said. ""I think they are starting to realize that there is a huge push-back on their growth.""

Across the Bay Area, tech companies have become synonymous with unprecedented growth and gentrification. Shuttles that ferry tech commuters from San Francisco to Silicon Valley have been derided as ""Google buses,"" and have been sporadically blockaded over the years.

Tech companies have tried to make nice with their critics.

When Apple Inc. built its fancy headquarters in the Silicon Valley city of Cupertino, capable of holding thousands of workers, it paid about $6 million into an affordable housing fund and invested $75 million to improve infrastructure and ease traffic in nearby cities. It still faced objections from housing advocates, who felt the company could do more. This year, Microsoft Corp. pledged $500 million to develop affordable housing in and around its hometown of Seattle, and a group including Menlo Park-based Facebook Inc. launched a similar project in the Bay Area.

In its housing pledge Tuesday, Google said it will lease some of its land to developers and take steps to rezone property from commercial or office use to residential. Pichai said in his blog post that the housing will be ""at all income levels in the Bay Area, including housing options for middle and low-income families.""

He did not specify where the land would be located or how many would be affordable housing units. Google told The Times that some of the overall housing units may come on land it owns in Mountain View that it already worked with the city to rezone to allow for residential development. Google has offices in several Bay Area cities including Mountain View, Sunnyvale and San Francisco, and it plans to open a campus in San Jose -- all of which Google told The Times could be places for residential development.

In addition to its pledge to lease its land to build at least 15,000 homes, Google said it will launch a $250-million investment fund that will give incentives to developers to build at least 5,000 affordable housing units. Separately, through the company's philanthropic division, Google will provide $50 million in grants for nonprofits that deal with homelessness and displacement.

Google's commitment toward more housing is the largest one made by a San Francisco Bay Area company in recent years, according to the Bay Area Council, a business-sponsored public policy group.

Few tech companies have committed to building on their own properties, even as their employees represent a large portion of a city's workers. Facebook is building a new campus in Menlo Park and plans to grow its workforce in the city to 35,000 employees -- roughly the same number of people as the city's own population. Facebook plans to build 1,500 rental housing units as part of its campus.

Tech companies have also recognized that the cost of living in the Bay Area is a liability for them: Prospective hires worry about prices in the Bay Area and how far they'll travel to and from the office.

Facebook has opened offices in other Bay Area cities, including Fremont and San Francisco, in an effort to be nearer to where its workers live.

Last year, Facebook-owned Instagram -- which is also based in Menlo Park -- opened an office in San Francisco, in part because potential recruits were turned off by the hour-plus commute.

It is the largest single commitment from a tech company to fight the housing shortage that threatens to stall the economic engine of Silicon Valley, as even well-paid workers must wrestle with escalating rents or finding a home to buy.

""For several months, we have encouraged Google to make a bold commitment to address our region's affordable housing challenge,"" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a statement to this news organization. ""We look forward to working with Google to ensure today's announcement manifests itself into housing that will benefit thousands of San Jose residents struggling under the burden of high rents.""

The initiative comes as Google faces enormous pressure to alleviate the impact of its rapid growth, particularly as it plans a transit-oriented mixed-use campus in downtown San Jose where 15,000 to 20,000 of its employees would work.

""I applaud Google's leadership for stepping forward to build affordable homes for California's working families,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom stated in a Twitter post. ""I hope today's announcement inspires other companies - big and small - to make similar direct investments in housing affordability throughout our state.""

Other tech companies have made financial contributions to housing, but nothing on this scale.

In January, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the San Francisco Foundation, Facebook, Genentech, and others announced a new $500 million fund to build or preserve more than 8,000 homes in five Bay Area counties over the next five to 10 years. Microsoft has committed $500 million to build affordable housing and tackle homelessness in the Seattle area, and Wells Fargo recently said it would spend $1 billion for affordable housing as part of a broader national philanthropic push.

But Google, in an unusual turn, said in a blog post it would spend $750 million to build housing on its own land.

Aimed at freeing up land for 15,000 homes, this process could take up to 10 years. Google would work with cities to rezone land that is mostly designated for office or commercial uses. In 2018, a scant 3,000 homes were built in the South Bay, Google noted.

The tech titan also will create a $250 million investment fund that will enable developers to build at least 5,000 affordable housing units across the region, according to the blog post from Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive officer.

The announcement comes as groups like Working Partnerships USA, a labor-backed organization focused on addressing inequality and poverty in Silicon Valley, have raised concerns that Google's foray into San Jose could trigger gentrification and displacement.

""It's encouraging to see Google taking the concerns of local communities seriously by recognizing some responsibility for its role in our region's housing crisis,"" Jeffrey Buchanan, the group's director of public policy, said in a statement.

In a report published last week, Working Partnerships pressed Google to commit to helping build more than 17,000 homes in San Jose to help ensure tenants won't be saddled with an estimated $235 million in rent hikes by 2030, the approximate completion date for Google's transit village near the Diridon train station.

""Today, more than 45,000 of our employees call the Bay Area home,"" Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive officer, wrote. ""Across the region, one issue stands out as particularly urgent and complex: housing.""

The problem is intensified among those least equipped to tackle the skyrocketing and stubbornly high home prices and residential rental costs, Pichai asserted in the post.

""The lack of new supply, combined with the rising cost of living, has resulted in a severe shortage of affordable housing options for long-time middle- and low-income residents,"" Pichai said.

The tech titan's quest appears to be a remarkable effort, said Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group.

""Google has given us one billion more reasons to recognize them as the great company and the great community partner that they are,"" Guardino said. ""Google has clearly shown they are a company that believes in 'Yes in our backyard' and will donate their own backyard to make it happen.""

The initiative arrives at a time when the internet giant, through a head-spinning array of property purchases and rental deals, has dramatically widened its footprint in the Bay Area. Beyond San Jose, Mountain View-based Google also owns properties in cities such as Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. It wasn't immediately clear which Bay Area sites might become residential projects.

In San Jose alone, Google's deals could bring the Bay Area's largest city 22,000 to 27,000 new tech jobs.

In addition to the neighborhood near the Diridon train station in the city's downtown district, consisting of office buildings, homes, shops, and restaurants, the search behemoth has plans in north San Jose. There, near the city's airport, Google has leased four big office buildings where another 3,600 could work. And near San Jose's Alviso district, the company has bought five office buildings where 3,500 more could be employed. Google also has bought three giant industrial buildings near Alviso.

""We're really excited about their commitment to housing,"" said Leslye Corsiglia, the executive director of SV@Home, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing and has worked with Google throughout Santa Clara County.

The announcement could help satisfy a commitment the company made to San Jose to include affordable housing in its development near Diridon Station. But it doesn't absolve Google of other commitments. For instance, If the city passes a commercial impact fee - a fee paid by companies to help fund affordable housing -- Google would still be obliged to pay that fee.

""It definitely stands out as a big investment,"" Corsiglia said, adding that she appreciates that the company is helping offset some of the impact of the jobs it is creating. ""That's not something you see every day.""

And while San Jose's planning department has resisted some attempts to rezone its shrinking supply of industrial land, Liccardo has also called for some 25,000 units of housing to be built in the city in the next several years.

""The housing crisis is the effect of the Bay Area being an economy that is the envy of the world,"" said Jim Wunderman, president of the Bay Area Council. ""It's reasonable that we are seeing major institutions like Google stepping up to the next level to help.""

Google said that it hopes the first new homes can be quickly launched.

""Our goal is to get housing construction started immediately, and for homes to be available in the next few years,"" Pichai stated. ""In Mountain View, we've already worked with the city to change zoning in the North Bayshore area to free up land for housing, and we're currently in productive conversations with Sunnyvale and San Jose.""

Google also said it would provide $50 million in grants through Google.org to nonprofits focused on the issues of homelessness and displacement.

""This is an absolute game-changer for San Jose and the South Bay,"" said Teresa Alvarado, director of the San Jose office of SPUR, a nonprofit civic planning organization. ""This should be an absolute model for other companies and other communities. I hope this tells local government officials that it's OK to build housing.""

Google has already taken preliminary steps to create potential housing sites that would flank the company's future mega-campuses in downtown San Jose, northern Sunnyvale, and north Mountain View. In all of these development zones, Google has assembled sufficient parcels that the company could provide stretches of land for homes within walking distance of its offices of tomorrow.

""Solving a big issue like the housing shortage will take collaboration across business, government and community organizations,"" Pichai wrote in the blog post.",34,,19-Jun-19,Google Puts Up $1b To Ease Housing Headaches It Helped Cause,531,Nbc Washington Dc,,"Google Puts Up $1b To Ease Housing Headaches It Helped Cause

Wells Fargo. Kaiser Permanente. Salesforce's Marc Benioff. Now Google.

One by one, the corporate titans of the Bay Area are vowing to plow dollars into solving the region's biggest crisis - housing.

It's a sign of just how serious the problem has become, for employees who need a place to live and also for the region's major companies, which are under fire from their communities because their workers are displacing longtime residents.

Google's announcement Tuesday that it would put $1 billion toward housing - including affordable units for the community and housing for its employees - came weeks after Wells Fargo pledged the same round number - $1 billion - toward housing affordability over the next six years.

Also new this year: The Partnership for the Bay's Future, a group of local foundations and companies including Facebook and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, is raising $540 million for affordable housing. In January, Kaiser Permanente said it will put aside $100 million to grow affordable housing in Bay Area cities and other places where the health system operates.

Salesforce's billionaire co-founder Marc Benioff and his wife, Lynne, have put up tens of millions of dollars to fund research on homelessness, subsidize rents for the newly housed and back a ballot measure that passed in November that will tax big businesses in San Francisco to help pay for homeless programs.

It's a subject that preoccupies every employer in the region.

United Airlines, which has more than 12,000 employees and a huge maintenance base near San Francisco International Airport, has looked at building units of housing for employees, according to Scott Kirby, the airline's president. Many employees, after meeting a minimum of months worked, ask to transfer somewhere with a lower cost of living, Kirby told The Chronicle last year.

""It's a challenge that's broader than us,"" Kirby said. ""It seems to me that the community needs to solve this somehow. We'd love to be a part of that solution, but it's hard for any one company to solve.""

As corporations in the Bay Area rode a wave of unprecedented job growth, the public sector let housing problems fester, said Nathan Ho, who leads housing policy at Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a business advocacy organization.

Cities are building only a small portion of what's necessary. From 2010 to 2015, the Bay Area added 367,064 jobs but only 57,094 housing units, according to a 2017 report by the Silicon Valley Leadership Group and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. The Building Industry Association estimates that 1.5 jobs per housing unit is a ""healthy balance.""

""To solve our housing emergency, all of us - government, business, housing advocates, neighbors - must work together,"" said state Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, whose bill to spur denser housing around transit hubs was put on hold until next year.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has already asked tech companies to pitch in. He met with executives from Silicon Valley corporations in January about committing $500 million to help build housing aimed at middle-income families.

In a statement provided by Google, the governor said Tuesday he applauds Google for recognizing ""it has an important role to play in addressing California's cost crisis.""

Google's proposal would build at least 15,000 housing units on its land, spread across the North Bayshore area of Mountain View, Sunnyvale and San Jose. It would not be limited to Google employees. As part of the initiative, the company also said it will establish a $250 million investment fund to help finance 5,000 affordable units close to its offices and around transit hubs, though it acknowledged its money would only meet a small portion of the 5,000-unit goal.

Issi Romem, chief economist at Trulia, said that Google is taking the right approach by adding units of housing, instead of handing out rent vouchers. It's tackling the problem and not the symptoms.

Google's announcement comes one week after a San Jose advocacy group, Working Partnerships USA, released a report saying Google's proposed new campus at Diridon Station will raise rents by $235 million a year.

Maria Noel Fernandez, the group's campaign director, said it will follow up with Google to make sure its continued growth adds opportunities for working families, not just tech workers.

""The announcement demonstrates that Google is listening to the thousands ... who have demanded the tech giant take responsibility for its role in the housing crisis,"" she said in a statement.

A number of local companies are ponying up funds to build housing as part of a strategic plan, said Megan Abell, director of advocacy at TechEquity Collaborative, an Oakland nonprofit that seeks to educate and engage tech workers on civic issues. Those businesses are ""hungry for talent,"" she said. ""Their companies are not going to be able to continue to grow, and certainly not grow in a way that's sustainable, unless we have cities and infrastructure that supports that growth - and that includes workforce housing.""

Abell said while she commends Google for its sizable donation, it's a ""one-time drop in the bucket."" She wants to see companies lobby for policies that would create a more functional housing market.

Whether it's enlightened self interest or flat recognition of the housing crisis, Google's pledge to create 20,000 homes is nothing to ignore. The tech giant has the money, land and motivation to deliver in meeting a major challenge.

The firm is promising a mix of units spread across its holdings in the South Bay, regularly cited as one of the costliest residential markets in the nation. Google has run into criticism that a new campus in San Jose will drive up rents even further.

Other entities such as Wells Fargo and Kaiser along with the Facebook-backed Partnership for the Bay Area's Future are pouring nine-figure sums into moderate-priced housing. It's a late blooming realization that soaring job growth comes with inescapable side effects. The big winners, especially in tech, have a role to play.

The Google plan calls for $750 million to create 15,000 units across the income scale over 10 years. Another $250 million would be available for private developers to build their own projects tailored for moderate incomes. Compare Google's studied proposal with the approach Amazon took in pressing for concessions in locating a second headquarters.

Along with the size of Google's and other housing initiatives will be the timing. It can't happen fast enough.

As Google CEO Sundar Pichai noted, the 2,000 units per year pace that his firm is outlining compares with 3,000 dwellings built last year in Silicon Valley. He also rightly acknowledged where the need lies: moderate- and low-income housing that's squeezed out by roaring development.

Both the state and cities such as San Francisco are putting money into new housing plans. But those efforts aren't enough. Huge firms such as Google should be willing to play a part both for their own workforce and the larger communities where they're located.

Google's blueprints are receiving warm words, most notably from local groups worried about the persistent pressure on scarce housing. Such corporate contributions to the housing challenge are a trend to welcome and encourage.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Google is pouring $1 billion into easing the high-priced housing headaches that it and its Silicon Valley peers helped give the San Francisco Bay Area.

The pledge announced Tuesday by Google CEO Sundar Pichai consists of a $250 million investment fund and $750 million of company-owned land. It will be used to build at least 15,000 homes that will include low- and mid-income housing.

Google's commitment eclipsed a recent $500 million pledge made by Microsoft to combat housing shortages in the Seattle area and a $500 million housing fund created by a consortium including Facebook.

Google is extending a helping hand as it draws up plans to expand into sprawling offices beyond its headquarters in Mountain View, California. That suburban city of roughly 80,000 people has been swamped with affluent tech workers since Google moved there shortly after its 1998 inception.

Since then, Google's payroll has swelled from a few dozen workers to the more than 103,000 people now working for it and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Nearly half of those workers are based in the Bay Area.

While Google has been expanding, so have a wide variety of other technology companies, including Apple, Facebook, Oracle, Salesforce and Netflix - all of whom also lavish their workers with six-figure salaries and stock options that can yield multimillion-dollar windfalls.

The high incomes have resulted in bidding wars for the limited supply of homes in the Bay Area that can only be afforded by the affluent, a group increasingly dominated by tech workers, while people employed in other lines of work struggle to make ends meet on more modest incomes.

That is making it impossible for people on the lower end of the economic spectrum to buy a home in the Bay Area, where a mid-priced house sold for $990,000 in April, according to the California Association of Realtors, a trade group. In 1999, a mid-priced home sold for $308,000.

It's even worse in San Francisco, a city from which many tech workers ride company buses to the Silicon Valley suburbs. A mid-priced house in San Francisco sold for nearly $1.7 million in April, according to the realtors' group, quadruple the price of 20 years ago.

Google's next big project will be in the Bay Area's most populous city, San Jose , where it plans to build a corporate campus consisting of offices and housing where 15,000 to 20,000 of its employees will work and live.

The project faced resistance from community activists worried about its effect on housing prices. Last week, a report by Working Partnerships called upon Google to build more than 17,000 homes in the area to help offset the anticipated price increases caused by the new campus. The report by the labor-union backed labor group envisions apartment rent increases of $235 million by 2030 if action isn't taken.

""For several months, we have encouraged Google to make a bold commitment to address our region's affordable housing challenge,"" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a statement applauding the company's $1 billion pledge.",39,,18-Jun-19,Google To Invest $1 Billion In San Francisco Bay Area Housing Amid Regional,287,Cnbc,,"Google To Invest $1 Billion In San Francisco Bay Area Housing Amid Regional

HIGHLIGHT:еКOf that, $750 million is earmarked for building 15,000 homes on the company's own land.

MOUNTAIN VIEW  Google on Tuesday announced a stunning $1 billion commitment to ease the Bay Areas housing crisis, pledging to add about 20,000 homes across the region.

It is the largest single commitment from a tech company to fight the housing shortage that threatens to stall the economic engine of Silicon Valley, as even well-paid workers wrestle with escalating rents or finding a home to buy.

We look forward to working with Google to ensure todays announcement manifests into housing that will benefit thousands of San Jose residents struggling under the burden of high rents, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a statement.

The initiative comes as Google faces enormous pressure to alleviate the impact of its rapid growth, particularly as it plans a transit-oriented mixed-use campus in downtown San Jose where 15,000 to 20,000 of its employees would work.

I applaud Googles leadership for stepping forward to build affordable homes for Californias working families, Gov. Gavin Newsom stated in a Twitter post. I hope todays announcement inspires other companies  big and small  to make similar direct investments in housing affordability throughout our state.

Other tech companies have made financial contributions to housing, but nothing on this scale.

In January, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the San Francisco Foundation, Facebook, Genentech, and others announced a new $500 million fund to build or preserve more than 8,000 homes in five Bay Area counties over the next five to 10 years. Microsoft has committed $500 million to build affordable housing and tackle homelessness in the Seattle area, and Wells Fargo recently said it would spend $1 billion for affordable housing as part of a broader national philanthropic push.

But Google, in an unusual turn, said in a blog post it would set aside $750 million of its own land for housing.

Aimed at freeing up space for 15,000 homes, the еКprocess could take up to 10 years. Google would work with cities to rezone land that is mostly designated now for office or commercial uses. In 2018, 3,000 homes were built in the South Bay, Google noted.

While Google has not specified where the homes would be built, the company has already taken preliminary steps to create potential housing sites that would flank its future mega-campuses in downtown San Jose, northern Sunnyvale, and north Mountain View. In all of these areas, Google has assembled sufficient parcels that the company could provide stretches of land for homes within walking distance of its offices of tomorrow. In Mountain View, Google already is helping develop up to 8,000 homes near its Googleplex.

The tech titan also will create a $250 million investment fund that will enable developers to build at least 5,000 affordable housing units across the region, according to the blog post from Sundar Pichai, Googles chief executive officer.

The announcement comes as groups like Working Partnerships USA, a labor-backed organization, have raised concerns that Google's foray into San Jose could trigger gentrification and displacement.

Its encouraging to see Google taking the concerns of local communities seriously by recognizing some responsibility for its role in our regions housing crisis, Jeffrey Buchanan, the groups director of public policy, said in a statement.

In a report published last week, Working Partnerships pressed Google to commit to helping build more than 17,000 homes in San Jose to help ensure tenants wont be saddled with an estimated $235 million in rent hikes by 2030, the approximate completion date for Googles transit village near the Diridon train station.

Today, more than 45,000 of our employees call the Bay Area home, еКPichaiеКwrote. Across the region, one issue stands out as particularly urgent and complex: housing.

The tech titans quest is a remarkable effort, said Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, whose members include all of the regions major tech employers.

Google has clearly shown they are a company that believes in Yes in our backyard and will donate their own backyard to make it happen, Guardino said.

In San Jose alone, Googles deals could bring the Bay Areas largest city 22,000 to 27,000 new tech jobs.

In addition to the neighborhood near the Diridon train station in the citys downtown district, consisting of office buildings, homes, shops, and restaurants, the search behemoth has plans in north San Jose. There, near the citys airport, Google has leased four big office buildings where another 3,600 could work. And near San Joses Alviso district, the company has bought five office buildings where 3,500 more could be employed. Google also has bought three giant industrial buildings near Alviso.

Google hasnt specified what the mix of new construction and renovation will be, so its difficult to evaluate how many units of housing the $1 billion will actually fund.

Still, the announcement could help satisfy a commitment the company made to San Jose to include affordable housing in its development near Diridon Station. But it doesn't absolve Google of other commitments. For instance, if the city passes a commercial impact fee  a fee paid by companies to help fund affordable housing Google would still be obliged to contribute to that fund.

And while San Joses planning department has resisted some attempts to rezone its shrinking supply of industrial land, Liccardo has also called for some 25,000 units of housing to be built in the city in the next several years.

The housing crisis is the effect of the Bay Area being an economy that is the envy of the world, said Jim Wunderman, president of the Bay Area Council. Its reasonable that we are seeing major institutions like Google stepping up to the next level to help.

Google said that it hopes the first new homes can be quickly launched.

In Mountain View, we've already worked with the city to change zoning in the North Bayshore area to free up land for housing, and we're currently in productive conversations with Sunnyvale and San Jose, Pichai stated.

How easily could this happen? San Joses mayor noted that some challenges could arise in connection with the shrinking number of available sites that are suitable for office, research, or industrial development, especially in jobs-poor communities such as his city. Liccardo said hes had discussions about these situations with Googles top real estate executives.

We do need more resources and we also need smaller cities, particularly our suburbs, to step up in a big way, Liccardo said. He added, That means they have to have a willingness to build the housing within their city limits, and right now there are too few cities with a willingness to build the housing.

HIGHLIGHT:еКVoting structure all but ensures the 13 shareholder proposals will fail, but investors say they want to make a point to the company, the public and Congress.

Google parent Alphabet is facing 13 shareholder proposals at its annual meeting Wednesday, the latest tech giant forced to deal with growing discontent from investors and others.

Some of the proposals address issues that have made headlines in the past year or so, including Googles plans to once again operate a search engine in China, extremist content on its platforms, sexual harassment in the workplace, and employment practices and contracts that make it tough for employees to seek redress.

Other proposals are aimed at the companys structure. Amid calls for breaking up tech companies and talk of antitrust action, one urges exploring strategic alternatives that include selling off parts of the business; another wants to require majority voting for electing directors to the board; and  after worker actions including the big walkout late last year  one wants to place an employee representative on the board.

We are troubled by the substantial deterioration of Alphabet's workplace brand over the last year, said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of CtW Investment Group, in a statement. Adding a non-executive employee representative to the Board will help restore employee confidence in senior leadership and help resolve the cultural crisis by adding much needed depth to the Board's perspective.

Investors at the annual meeting in Sunnyvale will also consider a proposal calling for equal voting rights. Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin hold 51 percent of voting power because of the companys multi-class voting structure  meaning all of the proposals, which the company is urging investors to vote against, are likely to fail.

NorthStar Asset Management in Boston has filed the proposal titled Give Each Share an Equal Vote since 2015, and has seen non-insider voter support for it rise 37 percent over four years.

Year after year, as shareholders file these proxies with increasing concern about the behavior of these companies, you can see a lot of dissatisfied people, including large institutional shareholders, said Julie Goodrich, CEO of NorthStar, in an interview. Especially in the tech industry, when we're looking at issues of privacy, government regulation and use of data, we're seeing shareholders getting more concerned that people at the top don't have the best interests of users and shareholders at the forefront of their mind.

She noted that last year, the resolution garnered 88 percent of non-insider shareholder votes, and 28.9 percent overall.

Google will invest $1bn in housing throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, a region plagued by a housing and homelessness crisis that has in part been fueled by the tech industry.

The announcement comes as the tech giant prepares to expand beyond its headquarters in Mountain View and its offices in San Francisco to new campuses in San Jose and Sunnyvale. The $1bn would go toward supporting the development of 20,000 new homes over the course of 10 years, or roughly 68% of the number of units the Bay Area needs to build each year in order to meet population growth.

""As we work to build a more helpful Google, we know our responsibility to help starts at home,"" Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, wrote in Tuesday's blog announcement. ""For us, that means being a good neighbor in the place where it all began over 20 years ago: the San Francisco Bay Area.""

The first step is to repurpose at least $750m of Google's land currently zoned for office or commercial space into residential housing over the course of 10 years, allowing for the development of 15,000 homes ""at all income levels"", Pichai wrote.

The remaining $250m will go into an investment fund to ""provide incentives to enable developers to build at least 5,000 affordable housing units across the market"".

The company also pledged an additional $50m in grants through Google.org to not-for-profit groups focused on homelessness and displacement.

""For several months, we have encouraged Google to make a bold commitment to address our region's affordable housing challenge,"" the San Jose mayor, Sam Liccardo, said in a statement. ""We look forward to working with Google to ensure today's announcement manifests into housing that will benefit thousands of San Jose residents struggling under the burden of high rents.""

The Bay Area has suffered through a housing crisis over the past few years, driven by a lack of affordable housing fueled in part by the economic disparities created by the tech industry. While the industry continues to grow at exponential rates, affordable housing has not been built to meet the need - the Bay Area Council Economic Institute estimates that 200,000 people are forced to commute into the Bay Area each day from as far out as the Central Valley because they cannot afford to live anywhere else.

The day before Google's announcement, Yolanda Chavez, a San Jose activist with Silicon Valley Rising, wrote a Medium post addressed to Pichai expressing her concerns that Google's new campus could drive up her rent and force her out of her home.

""I've had to sublet a bedroom and my living room out to strangers,"" she wrote. ""Many of my friends have already been priced out, forced to move to Stockton or Modesto. One now lives in Los BaМ±os, and has to drive back here every day to work. She leaves her house by 4am, doesn't get home until 11pm, and barely sees her family.""

""I know that if Google comes to San Jose and doesn't act responsibly to avoid driving rents even higher, I won't be able to stay here either,"" Chavez wrote.

Google's investment is a ""needle-mover"", said Matt Regan, senior vice-president of housing policy for the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.

""It's not going to solve the region's housing affordability problems in and of itself. But it sets the standard for others to follow,"" he said. ""What Google has done is go above and beyond, and I think it sets the standard for local governments as well that they need to go above and beyond to be part of the solution.""

The Bay Area has long struggled to meet its housing needs. From 2007 to 2014, the nine counties of the Bay Area permitted just 57% of the number of units needed to meet population growth, Regan explained. In pledging to support the development of 20,000 units, Google is vowing to take care of 68% of the 29,500 new homes the area is estimated to need each year.

Though Shanti Singh, communications coordinator with the not-for-profit Tenants Together, applauded Google for its investment, she questioned why only a quarter of the company's overall pledge would go toward affordable housing.

""There's an enormous need for funding for subsidized housing, especially for people who are being displaced in the vicinity of Google and Facebook and all these companies,"" Singh said. ""Everyone is struggling to find housing, but we need to be putting the priority on people who are suffering the most.""

Community activists have long called for tech companies to get involved in local social issues, especially the ones they helped create. Now that Google is stepping into the housing crisis, Singh hoped that the company would look into other issues happening within the company's backyard, such as efforts to repeal a rent control measure passed in 2016 in Mountain View, where Google is headquartered.

""If Google wants to be a neighbor and stand up for the people who are being disproportionately displaced, it also means getting involved in keeping people in their housing,"" she said.",44,Roland Li And Melia Russell,18-Jun-19,Google Puts Up $1 Billion To Fight Housing Crisis In Its Bay Area Backyard,959,The San Francisco Chronicle (california),Business,"Google Puts Up $1 Billion To Fight Housing Crisis In Its Bay Area Backyard

Google, some of whose employees must stretch to buy a home in the Bay Area, said Tuesday it will make a major investment to combat a housing crisis in its backyard.

Over the next decade, the Mountain View tech giant will establish a $250 million investment fund to help finance 5,000 affordable housing units close to its offices and near transportation hubs, the company said in a blog post.

Google didn't specify sites, but it has previously proposed new office and housing development in North Bayshore in Mountain View, the site of its Googleplex headquarters campus; at Moffett Park in Sunnyvale and near San Jose's Diridon Station.

The company is also giving $50 million in grants to nonprofits focused on homelessness and displacement.

""As we work to build a more helpful Google, we know our responsibility to help starts at home,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement. ""For us, that means being a good neighbor in the place where it all began over 20 years ago: the San Francisco Bay Area.""

As part of the investment, Google said it would ask local governments to rezone for housing some land it owns that is currently dedicated for office or commercial uses, with the goal of building at least 15,000 residential units. Those include the 5,700 units it proposed last year as part of its North Bayshore expansion.

A spokesman said the land is valued at north of $750 million and could sell for more. Instead, Google plans to lease parts of its land to residential developers, though it will not subsidize construction costs.

Including the value of the land, Google is characterizing the initiative as worth more than $1 billion. Google's parent company, Alphabet, earned $30.7 billion on $136.8 billion in revenue in 2018 and reported having $109.1 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand.

Pichai in his statement said Google's goal was to work with developers and cities ""to get housing construction started immediately, and for homes to be available in the next few years,"" noting that the company had worked with Mountain View to change zoning in North Bayshore and was ""currently in productive conversations with Sunnyvale and San Jose.""

Google and other Alphabet subsidiaries have been on an office expansion spree, with four new San Francisco leases in the past year, in addition to its Silicon Valley projects. The company is said to be seeking another 1 million square feet of office space in San Francisco, or space for more than 6,000 employees, The Chronicle reported this month.

""We are highly fortunate to have companies like Google who are providing jobs and supporting the economy, but it takes its toll on a limited housing stock,"" said Jim Wunderman, chief executive officer of the Bay Area Council.

Google has sparked backlash in San Jose, where it is proposing an enormous office complex near Diridon Station. Residents say the company's arrival will raise already-high rents. Working Partnerships USA, a San Jose advocacy group that is critical of the plan, said the Diridon project would raise rents by $235 million a year. The group said building 12,450 new market-rate housing units and 5,284 affordable homes are required to keep rents stable.

""It's encouraging to see Google taking the concerns of local communities seriously by recognizing some responsibility for its role in our region's housing crisis,"" said Jeffrey Buchanan, director of public policy at Working Partnerships USA, in a statement. ""There is clearly still more it needs to do, but it's a very welcome first step towards fully addressing its impact on rent hikes, evictions and overcrowding.""

Google noted that the Bay Area is home to more than 45,000 of its employees, who are often blamed for pricing out longtime residents. Some of those same workers have struggled to buy homes in the region. The average engineer at Google would have to spend nearly a third of their paycheck to afford a monthly mortgage near the headquarters, according to a 2018 report from Open Listings, a startup that helps customers with the home-buying process.

""Our goal is to help communities succeed over the long term and make sure that everyone has access to opportunity, whether or not they work in tech,"" Pichai said.

A Google spokesman said houses on Google land would be available to all, not reserved for employees.

There's a self-seeking upside in building housing near its offices, said Nathan Ho, senior director of housing and community development at Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a business advocacy group. It may help Google keep employees longer. Many of the group's 330 member companies say the housing crisis has made recruiting and retention harder, Ho said.

""We ask them what are you concerned about for the future of your company. The two issues - traffic and housing - are 50 percent"" of responses, Ho said. ""The other 50 percent is housing and traffic.""

Other large West Coast companies have committed to fund housing as the problem has become more acute. A partnership of Bay Area foundations and companies including Facebook are raising $540 million for affordable housing. Wells Fargo, which in the past has donated across an array of causes, narrowed its focus this month with a $1 billion contribution to provide housing relief. In January, Microsoft also said it would invest $500 million in affordable housing in Seattle.

In 2017, Google also bought hundreds of prefabricated modular homes from Vallejo startup Factory OS for short-term employee housing.

Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement provided by Google that he hopes the company's plans inspire other businesses to make similar direct investments in housing affordability.

""Google recognizes that it has an important role to play in addressing California's cost crisis,"" Newsom said.",45,Luke Stangel,18-Jun-19,"Google Rolls Out $1 Billion Plan To Build Up To 20,000 New Homes In The Bay Area",658,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Google Rolls Out $1 Billion Plan To Build Up To 20,000 New Homes In The Bay Area

Google on Tuesday unveiled a $1 billion plan to build up to 20,000 new homes in the Bay Area, with a special focus on affordable housing.

The Mountain View-based search giant said it will ask city governments to rezone $750 million worth of office and industrial land that it currently owns, and give it the green light to build 15,000 new homes over the next 10 years. The company will also open up a new $250 million investment fund for real estate developers, in hopes of building at least 5,000 affordable homes across the region.

It's also committing another $50 million in grants for groups focused on homelessness and displacement.

""In the coming months, we'll continue to work with local municipalities to support plans that allow residential developers to build quickly and economically,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a blog post. ""Our goal is to get housing construction started immediately, and for homes to be available in the next few years.

Pichai's announcement was short on firm details, like where the new homes would be built, who would build them, how much they would cost, and who would be eligible to buy them.

""In Mountain View, we've already worked with the city to change zoning in the North Bayshore area to free up land for housing, and we're currently in productive conversations with Sunnyvale and San Jose,"" he wrote.

Last year, the Alphabet Inc.-owned company quietly sent out requests for proposals to construction startups like Menlo Park-based Katerra, and Vallejo-based Factory OS to figure out how much it would cost to build up to 10,000 modular homes around its growing headquarters in Mountain View.

Pichai called the region's housing crisis an issue that was both ""urgent and complex.""

Urgent, because there were just 3,000 new homes built in the South Bay in 2018, and complex, because Google itself is contributing to the problem, by paying most of its 45,000 employees in the greater Bay Area salaries well into six figures each. In 2018, Google's median employee salary came in at $246,804.

Housing market effect

Google has quietly amassed a multibillion-dollar portfolio of commercial properties in the South Bay that could eventually allow for more than 20,000 new Google employees in San Jose alone.

Last week, the labor-affiliated think tank Working Partnerships USA published a report suggesting the cost of an apartment in Santa Clara County would rise by $765 per year if Google didn't attempt to offset the impact of its new commercial developments in downtown San Jose.

""For several months, we have encouraged Google to make a bold commitment to address our region's affordable housing challenge,"" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a statement on Tuesday. ""We look forward to working with Google to ensure today's announcement manifests into housing that will benefit thousands of San JosМ© residents struggling under the burden of high rents.""

In addition to Google's plans for a transit-oriented campus in downtown San Jose that could eventually span 8 million square feet, the search giant is expanding around its Mountain View headquarters, has development plans in neighboring Sunnyvale, and has taken large chunks of San Francisco's Financial District. It has also assembled a set of buildings in North San Jose, indicating that its interest in the city extends beyond San Jose's core.

Carl Guardino, president and CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a South Bay business advocacy group of which Google is a member, praised the company's announcement. ""While so many people in the Bay Area are saying 'not in my backyard,' Google has placed their wallet where their words are with 'yes' in their own backyard with up to 20,000 new homes with all levels of affordability for Bay Area residents,"" Guardino said in a statement.

Google development in downtown San Jose could result in $235 million in rent increases by 2030 if nearly 5,300 affordable homes and 12,500 market-rate homes do not enter the market, according to a report released Wednesday by a San Jose nonprofit.

The city approved a $110 million ""mega-campus"" for Google in December after immense pushback from local residents who said the move would aggravate gentrification and already-skyrocketing housing prices in Silicon Valley.

The city expects to collect 24.8 million in property tax revenue from the roughly 7 million square-foot project each year, according to the study, but a lack of sufficient housing could cost renters $127.4 million from rents almost five times as high as they are now.

Residents and activists gathered with the nonprofit Working Partnerships USA outside City Hall on Wednesday attributed the jump in rents to the ""Google Effect,"" which could cause property values to soar around the lucrative development.

June 02: Comcast SportsNet Bay Area Holdings, Inc.: Partisan Control Determines How States Act on Voting Rights

New York voters for years have experienced some of the longest wait times in the nation on Election Day. Attempts to fix the problem routinely became casualties of the divided politics of the state Legislature.

That dynamic changed last November, when Democrats won majorities in both legislative chambers, and it didn't take them long to act.

Just weeks into this year's legislative session, they passed a bill to allow early voting, and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo promptly signed it.

""Early voting is going to make a significant difference for countless numbers of New Yorkers by making polling places so much more accessible and allow voters to determine when it is most convenient for them,"" said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York.

(Published Friday, May 31, 2019) New York is among a small number of states where Democrats made big gains in last year's election and have used that power to pass laws to make it easier to register and to vote. They have introduced early voting, all-mail voting or automatic registration.

A few Republican-led states - some of which saw high turnout for Democratic candidates - are going in the opposite direction, advancing bills to tighten voter registration and early voting.

May 02: Comcast SportsNet Bay Area Holdings, Inc.: Colorado Sen. Bennet Launches Democratic Presidential Bid

U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado jumped into the packed Democratic presidential primary on Thursday, announcing a 2020 campaign that had been stalled while he was treated for prostate cancer.

Bennet, a former head of Denver Public Schools who has carved out a reputation as a policy-oriented moderate, made his announcement on CBS' ""CBS This Morning.""

The son of a former ambassador to India and a Yale law school graduate who worked in the Clinton administration, Bennet worked for Republican billionaire Phil Anschutz when he moved to Colorado in the late 1990s. But when he re-entered public life, he did so as a Democrat, serving as chief of staff to then-Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper. Hickenlooper went on to become Colorado governor and now is also competing for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The presence of two moderate Coloradans who started their political careers in Denver City Hall reflects how crowded the Democratic presidential field has become. Bennet's understated style and distaste for the sound bites required in a political campaign have usually led to speculation that he'd seek a Cabinet position rather than try to become the next president. But he began moving to assemble a presidential bid late last year and planned an announcement in April. He had to pause after being diagnosed with prostate cancer this spring.

February 12: Comcast SportsNet Bay Area Holdings, Inc.: Company Defends Taser Safety at San Mateo Supervisors Meeting About 3 Deaths

Representatives of Axon, the company that manufacturers Taser stun guns, defended the safety of the devices at a special meeting called by the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors on Monday to investigate the use of electronic control weapons in the wake of three deaths last year.

Axon representatives argued that the devices were the safest intermediate force option, causing less serious injuries than pepper spray, dogs or batons, and had never conclusively lead to a fatal electrocution, an assertion that drew jeers and laughter from the audience in the packed chambers in Redwood City.

When asked by Supervisor David Pine about the extensive warnings that are distributed with Tasers, including that for certain vulnerable people Tasers ""may cause or contribute to sudden death,"" Axon attorney Michael Brave minimized the importance of the warnings.

""It's just like ladders and acetaminophen, if you read all of the warnings you'll never use any of those things,"" Brave told the supervisors.

When Kevin Durant took the floor in Wednesday night's 141-102 win, and immediately began blistering the San Antonio Spurs with his deadeye shooting, it was only a prelude for the fireworks to come.

The postgame interview session, Durant's first public comments since Jan. 28, devolved into the purest sort of theater: That of a man unleashing his frustrations, honestly and furiously, without regard for decorum.

At the root of it all was the Knicks trading All-Star forward Kristaps Porzingis last week to clear salary-cap space for at least one, and perhaps two free agents in July.

Durant becomes a free agent on July 1. New York for much of this season has been considered his possible destination.

Created by www.buysellsignals.com for News Bites Finance",49,,15-Jun-19,No Relief On Housing In Sight;,569,The San Francisco Chronicle (california),Insight; Editorials; Pg. A9,"No Relief On Housing In Sight;

This spring, Bay Area housing prices flattened out for two months in a row. After years of heady, month-over-month price appreciations and rental spikes, this rare break created an opportunity for price-exhausted communities to take a closer look at the trends of our local housing crisis.

Sadly, those trends are as grim as they ever were.

On Thursday, Curbed SF released the results of its compilation of five years' worth of reported median rents in San Francisco from five rental platforms. It found that San Francisco's median rent on all of them reached its highest-ever height at some point in 2019.

On Zumper, a platform that also tracks national rents, the most recent median rent in San Francisco - $3,700 a month for a one-bedroom apartment in June - is the highest it's ever recorded for any city in the country.

The results varied for each site, and no single source represents a full picture of San Francisco's market rental prices.

Still, the overall trend was both clear and stark: Rent has never been higher in San Francisco, and it's going to take a lot more than a couple of months of flat prices for the Bay Area to dig out of this historic housing crisis.

It's going to take courage, vision and a keen understanding of how the region reconfigures its balance between housing and jobs.

On the latter, there are deep concerns brewing in San Jose after a new economic analysis this week showed that Google's proposed expansion in downtown San Jose could cost that city's renters an additional $235 million in higher rents every year without a significant increase in both affordable and market-rate housing production.

The analysis, conducted by Beacon Economics on behalf of a San Jose nonprofit, Working Partnerships USA, found that Google and San Jose would need to subsidize 5,284 affordable housing units and help produce 12,450 market-rate units to prevent these dramatic rent hikes.

What adds to the depressing nature of this report is the fact that San Jose voters recently rejected a $450 million affordable-housing bond.

City officials have said that San Jose provided housing for the rest of the region while other cities, particularly on the Peninsula, attracted corporate campuses without building their fair share of homes. This claim has merit.

Unfortunately, we now need every city in the region to focus on home-building, and there are still too few that are willing to do so.

For this week's example, we need look no further than Berkeley.

UC Berkeley has been trying to build two new buildings for classrooms and housing on its campus. In exchange for this perfectly sensible and badly needed project, it was sued by a neighborhood group on Wednesday.

The group's contentions read like a ""Greatest Hits"" NIMBY compilation: neighborhood character, supposed California Environmental Quality Act violations, the terror of increased trash and noise.

But the unoriginality of their gripes shouldn't detract from the very real problems this behavior has brought to the Bay Area - this crisis affects us all, and no local governments are fighting hard enough to make a difference for their increasingly stressed residents.

Small wonder the last two months of ""flat prices"" haven't felt like a reprieve.

An almost 800-unit ""co-living"" project in downtown San Jose is moving toward a 2021 opening date after securing final city approvals last month.

Starcity, a San Francisco-based startup that develops dorm-like residential buildings for adults, said this week that it has gained approvals for the 18-story residential tower at 199 Bassett St. When complete, the project will be the largest co-living project in the world, it said.

The project sits three blocks from San Pedro Square, and about a mile from the area where search giant Google is assembling land for a planned campus around the Diridon Transit center that could span 8 million square feet.

Co-living buildings, sometimes called ""adult dorms,"" are marketed as a more affordable option than many market-rate apartments because kitchens, living rooms and sometimes bathrooms are communal. Many also offer flexible lease terms as short as three months.

Starcity CEO Jon Dishotsky previously told the Business Journal that the San Jose market is ripe for this kind of housing: ""There's starting to be a pretty big boom [in San Jose] and we want to make sure that's not just high-end condos and expensive hotels,"" he said in a December interview. ""We really saw it as an opportunity to put a flag in the ground and really be intentional about it.""

In February, after working with Starcity, San Jose's City Council approved zoning changes that paved the way for such projects to rise by formally recognizing co-living as a use category.

""We struggle so greatly just to get a shovel in the ground to get housing in the city, because construction costs are so high right now,"" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a statement sent out by Starcity on Wednesday. ""The fact that the developer had found an approach that could get housing built was a good enough signal to me that we should get any obstacles out of the way.""

Liccardo has previously talked about how he'd like to spur new development in San Jose - reducing and simplifying city fees, being more flexible about rules such as zoning codes, and considering raising the building height limits around the city core.

The heights issue was dealt with in March, when city leaders approved taller limits for new buildings in the city core. Already, the new rules have prompted at least one developer to build higher: Jay Paul Co. said earlier this week that it has tweaked designs for a newly acquired downtown tower project at 200 Park Ave. to take advantage of the increased limits.

Starcity purchased the Bassett Street property -еКoriginally proposed as regular multifamily housing - from local developer KT Urban for $18 million in February.

The typical floor in the project will have three to four chef-style kitchens ""and both large group and more intimate dining areas,"" Starcity said. The building will also have a 5,000-square-foot fitness center, bike storage and repair facility, co-working areas, underground parking and ground-floor retail space that may include a small cafe, grocery store or bar, the developer said.

It has not yet announced pricing for its San Jose project, but rents start at $2,075 in Starcity's property in San Francisco's Mission District.

Starcity also recently secured approvals for a 270-unit co-living project in San Francisco. That development, at 475 Minna St., was streamlined through the entitlement process with the help of SB 35, a controversial new California housing law that aims to encourage multi-family housing development in the state. Half of the units in the San Francisco project will be deed-restricted to below-market rates, with rents as low as $850 on some units.

The additional housing demand created by Google's planned downtown San Jose expansion would exacerbate the local housing crisis and raise local rents by hundreds of dollars per family annually, says a report published today by Working Partnerships USA.

The labor-affiliated think tank, which has long called for a stronger commitment from Google to mitigating adverse effects of its downtown plans, considers a $900 million housing investment from the company in San Jose ""feasible"" based on commitments it has made in the area around its North Bayshore development in Mountain View.

""With a reasonable investment in housing across levels of affordability, Google could prevent these impacts and avoid replicating Silicon Valley's pattern of housing underproduction, mega-commutes and displacement,"" Robert Kleinhenz, research director at Los Angeles-based Beacon Economics, which was commissioned by WPUSA to do the report, said in a press release.

Eddie Truong, head of government relations for The Silicon Valley Organization, formerly the chamber of commerce, criticized the report for making too many assumptions, including omitting the likelihood of a recession, and said it was premature.

""There currently isn't a finalized Google project,"" he said. ""(The report) is all speculation about impact on housing prices that is really not rooted in any reality.""

Anil Babbar, public affairs vice president for the California Apartment Association, also faulted the report's reliance on assumptions to predict conditions a decade away. ""We're expected to make significant policy decisions on a lot of assumptions that I simply can't verify or make sure they're accurate.""

SPUR's San Jose director Teresa Alvarado defended the city's efforts to address the housing crisis so far and questioned a report assumption that future downtown employees would all be new. ""A majority of Bay Area Google employees already live in the South Bay,"" she said.

The San Jose Downtown Association's Rick Jensen issued a statement saying the approved memorandum of understanding ""between the City of San Jose and Google makes clear that both parties are taking active steps to combat displacement and create affordable housing. Furthermore, there is a robust community engagement process through the Station Area Advisory Group (SAAG), which includes Working Partnerships. The SAAG will have the opportunity to review and provide feedback on any community benefits agreement.""

Based on its data, Working Partnerships' report estimates rents in Santa Clara County Jose would rise about $235 million annually - about $765 per apartment - without a commitment from Google ""to significant housing production.""

San Jose's share of the annual rent increase was pegged at $127.4 million a year, five times the $24.8 million it estimates the city would receive in annual property taxes. Avoiding those rent increases would require subsidizing 5,284 affordable housing units plus 12,540 market-rate units, according to the report.

Developer Jay Paul Co. has picked up another slice of downtown San Jose, paying $100 million for two additional properties next to the the block-sized CityView project it purchased last year as it assembles key parcels for a large, connected development in the city core.

The San Francisco-based developer's latest purchase is for two sites at the corner of Park Avenue and South Almaden Boulevard - across from CityView Plaza, which Jay Paul Co. bought last year for $283.5 million, and the office tower at 50 West San Fernando, which the developer is also reportedly in talks to buy.

One of the sites, at 200 Park Ave., has an existing proposal for an office tower that was submitted a year ago by seller JP DiNapoli. Janette D'Elia, chief operating officer at the Jay Paul Co., told the Business Journal that the developer is tweaking those plans with ""a new design that takes advantage of the recent height increase"" approved by the city of San Jose.

Jay Paul's proposal is for a 20-story building totaling about 850,000 square feet, she said, and the developer plans to break ground in late summer.

The other site, at 282 S. Almaden Blvd., currently serves as a parking lot for the next-door Hyatt Place hotel, and will be replaced with a development. The hotel is not included in the purchase.

Jay Paul Co. envisions one large campus across the trio of adjacent properties it now owns. ""We have some very exciting ideas for these properties,"" Matt Lituchy, the developer's chief investment officer, told the Mercury News, which first reported on the transactions. ""This is going to be a single development.""

The developer last year purchased CityView Plaza - the block-sized, mixed-use campus bounded by South Almaden Boulevard, Park Avenue, West San Fernando Street and South Market Street - and earlier this year revealed plans to demolish the existing buildings on the site and erect a glassy, 19-story, mixed-use campus spanning 3.4 million square feet.

""There's not a lot of opportunity in other parts of the Valley right now, and Jay wanting to continue to have a very robust pipeline also caused us to push out our sights a little bit farther,"" D'Elia said at a real estate event in March, explaining the developer's sudden expansion in the South Bay. ""San Jose came on the radar and once we started taking more time to look at it, we really decided that this would be our next big move.""

The project sits in the heart of downtown San Jose, next to Adobe Systems' growing campus and walking distance from San Jose's Diridon Station transit hub, around which Google is planning an urban mixed-use campus that could span 8 million square feet. Though Jay Paul Co. has said it doesn't yet have a tenant in tow for that three-building project, industry insiders have speculated that the project is designed for a single large tenant, perhaps a tech giant like Facebook or Google.

Jay Paul Co. paid $50 million each for the two properties at 200 Park Ave. and 282 S. Almaden Blvd., the Mercury News reports, citing county property records. The developer said it intends to submit a development proposal for the new sites to the city in coming months.

Phil Mahoney, executive vice chairman of Newmark Knight Frank, represented Jay Paul Co. in the deal. Mark Schmidt, senior managing director at CBRE, represented the sellers.

Between that deal, the pending purchase of the 50 West San Fernando tower, and last year's purchase of CityView, the developer will have invested close to $660 million in downtown San Jose in less than a year.

""We are really going to change the skyline of San Jose,"" Lituchy told the Mercury News.

Updated: 2019-06-07 Jon Dishotsky likes to tell the story of how he grew up in a co-housing compound, of a sort. His father, a Stanford professor, hosted dozens of students over the years, who paid low rent and cycled in and out of his suburban Palo Alto home. TheyМў(EURO)(TM)d share meals with his family and pitch in to take care of Dishotsky when his parents were busy. They helped build a zip line. It was a kind of ad-hoc community; heМў(EURO)(TM)s still in touch with some of these ex-students.Dishotsky, the co-founder/CEO of the co-housing start-up Starcity, is now working to fill AmericaМў(EURO)(TM)s housing-strapped cities with a scaled-up version of his childhood idyll. Since launching in 2016, the company has broken ground on seven developments in Los Angeles and San Francisco. In most Starcity buildings, renters get a furnished 130- to 220-square-foot bedroom and share a communal kitchen and living space. In a addition to a Мў(EURO)oegenerous bathroom to room ratio,Мў(EURO)

the company touts a range of Millennial-friendly amenities, including an honor library, Мў(EURO)oelocally sourced foliage,Мў(EURO) and Bob Ross painting nights. Rents range from $1,400 to $2,400 a month. Мў(EURO)oeWeМў(EURO)(TM)ll make the living arrangements delightful and sustainable so that people can stay in cities long-term,Мў(EURO) StarcityМў(EURO)(TM)s website promises. Мў(EURO)oeWe will do this by redefining the meaning of home.Мў(EURO)That definition is about to get a whole lot larger. Last week, the company got the green light to start work on its biggest projectМў(EURO)""an 18-story building with 803 units in the heart of downtown San Jose, a city in the crosshairs of CaliforniaМў(EURO)(TM)s housing crisis. This Titanic of co-housing is set to be the biggest shared-living-space-cum-mega-dorm-for-emerging-adults ever conceived. (Dishotsky pushed back on my abstract reference to the doomed liner. Мў(EURO)oeWe havenМў(EURO)(TM)t built the building yet!Мў(EURO) he wrote me in a follow-up email. Мў(EURO)oeAnd I wonМў(EURO)(TM)t drive us into an iceberg. It will be built to standards beyond code.Мў(EURO))Rents will start in the low-$2,000s, including furnishings, utilities, WiFi, and rapport-building building-wide events.Starcity is just one of a growing cadre of startups offering variations on this communal-living theme. Bungalow has converted more than 500 single-family homes to co-housing spaces in 10 U.S. cities. Common offers shared suites in six cities. WeLive, owned by the co-working goliath WeWork, rents studio and one-to-four bedroom apartments as well as communal ones in New York City and Washington D.C. And The Collective, a global brand, has high-rise co-housing complexes in London, New York, and soon, Chicago.These outfits all seem to speak the same aesthetic language. Their sleek promotional materials scream Мў(EURO)oeInstagrammable Friends episode, but more diverse,Мў(EURO) or perhaps just Мў(EURO)oeCoke commercial sponsored by Wayfair.Мў(EURO) Their roots, however, lie someplace older and grubbier: the low-budget single room occupancy hotels, or SROs, of the early 20th century. Just as industrial cities looked to SROs and flophouses to shelter their booming young urban workforce, Starcity is making buildings that can accommodate the live-work-play (but crucially, always-work) demands of a new labor class.Starcity considers itself distinct from SROs, however, in how it uses each building, as Curbed SF reported: Мў(EURO)oe95 percent of the usable square footage in an SRO is rentersМў(EURO)(TM) rooms, with the remaining five percent mostly hallways. By comparison, a Starcity building is about 65 percent bedrooms, and 20 percent of the building is dedicated to Мў(EURO)~communal spaces and kitchens.Мў(EURO)(TM)Мў(EURO) And renters commit to living there longer than the transient characters who once bunked at week-to-week boarding houses: More than 70 percent of tenants want leases longer than month-to-month, Dishotsky told Curbed.But this reinvention of an old housing model comes with new logistical hurdles.High-density co-housing buildings arenМў(EURO)(TM)t hotels, and theyМў(EURO)(TM)re not quite traditional multi-family apartments. To break ground on the San Jose mega-project, Starcity had to work with the city to change local zoning codes.The San Jose Starcity mega-project will be neighbors with GoogleМў(EURO)(TM)s new buildings, and the Diridon Transit Center. (Starcity)In San Francisco, Starcity uses the local zoning category Мў(EURO)oegroup housing,Мў(EURO) similar to what student dormitories use. L.A. zoning is more prohibitive. Co-housing developments there must be classified as multi-family, so the Starcity model is scaled down to pair every three to six rooms with a kitchen. But in San Jose, the city agreed to create a new use category entirely for the project. After approval of the rezoning by the city council in February, Мў(EURO)oeco-livingМў(EURO) became its own distinct land-use classification in April.Мў(EURO)oeTo our knowledge, this is the first dedicated Мў(EURO)~co-livingМў(EURO)(TM) zoning code to be established in the U.S.,Мў(EURO) says Eli Sokol, StarcityМў(EURO)(TM)s development manager.The rezoning speaks to how radical these spaces are, but also how much stake the city is putting in this modelМў(EURO)(TM)s potential for packing in more residents, for less.Once slated to host a 300-unit multi-family complex managed by local developer KT Urban, the land is now cleared to hold almost triple that occupancy. ItМў(EURO)(TM)s not just going to be the largest high-rise co-living building constructed: ItМў(EURO)(TM)s the largest one Мў(EURO)oeever proposedМў(EURO)""period,Мў(EURO) Sokol says.This makes sense for San Jose, a Silicon Valley city whose approach to housing has been, by necessity, Мў(EURO)oetry anything.Мў(EURO) After villages built out of shipping containers and a tiny homes pilot, a super-dense co-housing behemoth could be the next logical step.Мў(EURO)oeWe struggle so greatly just to get a shovel in the ground to get housing in the city, because construction costs are so high right now,Мў(EURO) says San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo. Мў(EURO)oeThe fact that the developer had found an approach that could get housing built was a good enough signal to me that we should get any obstacles out of the way.Мў(EURO)Average rents for a one-bedroom in San Jose have reached $2,700; the city topped ZillowМў(EURO)(TM)s list of Мў(EURO)oehottest housing marketsМў(EURO) nationwide this year. The strain on middle-income renters will only multiply: Google is planning to expand its downtown campus by eight million square feet, adding up to 15,000 employees to the area.The transformative urban implications of that development arenМў(EURO)(TM)t lost to Starcity. Another neighbor will be the Diridon Station transit center, which expects big upgrades and route expansions in the coming years. Мў(EURO)oeThe city blocks immediately to the south and west of the site are already under construction with dense urban residential and mixed-use projects that will help make San Jose a much more walkable and dynamic environment in the coming years,Мў(EURO) says Sokol.Besides creating a bespoke zoning category, San Jose swept away other barriers, including parking requirements (800 Millennials donМў(EURO)(TM)t need 800 parking spaces) and an inclusionary housing ordinance that holds developers to building 15 percent affordable units or paying a per-unit fee. When the Starcity project was first proposed, housing advocates in the city were cautiously optimistic about the role the giant complex might play in increasing supply, but were wary about the exemption.Мў(EURO)oeWhile many speakers and some councilmembers held the co-housing model up as naturally occurring affordable housing, SV@Home pointed out that the Мў(EURO)~unitsМў(EURO)(TM) are not really affordable,Мў(EURO) reads a statement from SV@Home, a local affordable housing policy group. Мў(EURO)oe[T]hey are not rent-restricted, and often charge rents well beyond the reach of lower-income households.Мў(EURO)But the deal will move forward with the exemptions, for now, because without them, pushing any high-rise towards completion has proven difficult, says Liccardo. Мў(EURO)oeI donМў(EURO)(TM)t pretend it will be a solution for large families or for homeless residents,Мў(EURO) he says. Мў(EURO)oeItМў(EURO)(TM)s a promising solution particularly for workforce housing.Мў(EURO)Construction is set to start in the fall, with a late 2021 opening, but Liccardo knows that a lot could still happen to derail the project. Мў(EURO)oeGiven the challenges of construction in the Bay Area, IМў(EURO)(TM)ll feel much more willing to express my pride at the ribbon cutting,Мў(EURO) he says.Bay Area renters seeking something more affordable could look to another Starcity development in San FranciscoМў(EURO)(TM)s SoMa neighborhood, whose permit was also approved last week. Rents at this 270-room, 16-story building will start around as low as $800 a monthМў(EURO)""Мў(EURO)oeno easy feat in San Francisco,Мў(EURO) says Sokol.Half of the units will be affordable for renters who make 80 percent of area median income or lower. This makes it one of the first developments to qualify for CaliforniaМў(EURO)(TM)s SB35 program, which offers an expedited building timeline for these more affordable buildings.Rooms at 457 Minna Street will start at $800 a month. (Starcity)But most co-housing developments donМў(EURO)(TM)t promote themselves as the cheapest bed in town: For that, finding a group home and cramming it with roommates can cost less, and youМў(EURO)(TM)ll still get to share spatulas and swap grunted hellos at the end of the workday. Instead, theyМў(EURO)(TM)re pitching community-building as both a luxe amenity and a salve for the Bay AreaМў(EURO)(TM)s tech-fueled social isolation.

But it could also be better than the alternative: isolation and loneliness, the scourges prophesied by so many Millennial trend stories.Fully breaking down that isolation would have to be both a product of community-building within the development, as well as interaction with the outside world, notes Alex Shoor, the co-founder of San Jose housing advocacy group CatalyzeSV.Мў(EURO)oeIf you look at successful cities across America, the best thing youМў(EURO)(TM)re going to do is if youМў(EURO)(TM)re going to create a tower or a tall building, make sure it has more than one use and that multiple types of people can enjoy and interact with that building,Мў(EURO) he says.

BART can finally start testing its new Silicon Valley extension from the East Bay to north San Jose, a six-month process that will allow transportation officials to open the long-romanticized rail line that took 21 years to build.

The South Bay's Valley Transportation Authority handed BART the keys to its still-vacant stations in Berryessa and Milpitas, where two months ago the garbage cans were shrink-wrapped.

Project spokeswoman Bernice Alaniz says the extension should open by the end of the year.

Meanwhile, BART's board is mulling a fare structure as the agencies haggle over an operating contract that must be finished before the new line can start service.

Since Santa Clara County isn't part of the BART district, it was left on its own to build the 10-mile extension and pay to run the trains. Although BART had long dreamed of building out its map in the South Bay, it didn't want to be left on the hook if the line failed to attract passengers.

After years of wary negotiations, the two sides are close to signing a deal, said Santa Clara Councilwoman Teresa O'Neill, who chairs the VTA. Santa Clara voters set aside a one-eighth-cent sales tax to operate the trains from Warm Springs to Berryessa. Consultants anticipate 23,000 daily riders, a number that could multiply when the second phase opens in downtown San Jose, where Google is building a massive campus. Reliable mass transit is a key element of the tech company's plan to add 20,000 jobs.

At this point, BART will align all the trains and stations with its operations control center. Its drivers will run empty trains along the new section of track. And next week, BART's board will vote on fares for the added stops: A one-way ticket from Embarcadero to Berryessa would probably cost $7.75, or $15.50 round trip.

The news elated Carl Guardino, president and CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group and a key booster of the project. He led the ballot campaign for the sales tax measure in 2008.

Jay Paul Co. is in talks to buy the prominent downtown San Jose office tower at 50 W. San Fernando St. for $230 million, the Mercury News reports, citing sources familiar with the deal.

The move would further the San Francisco developer's bold entrance into the heart of San Jose and could potentially set a new price record in the area.

The 18-story tower, called 50 West, sits across the street from downtown San Jose's CityView Plaza, the block-sized retail and office campus Jay Paul intends to tear down and redevelop after purchasing it for $283.5 million last year.

50 West is ""an iconic asset that makes total sense for Jay Paul's portfolio in downtown San Jose,"" Phil Mahoney, an executive vice chairman with Newmark Knight Frank, told the Mercury News, which noted that the sale has not officially closed or been documented in county property records.

Jay Paul Co. did not immediately respond to a Business Journal request for comment.

San Francisco-based DivcoWest and Boston-based Rockpoint Group have owned 50 West since December 2015, when they paid $165.5 million, or about $493 per square foot, to purchase the 367,000-square-foot building.

The property sits next to the San Jose Fairmont Hotel and San Jose Museum of Art and overlooks the Circle of Palms Plaza and Cesar Chavez Park. Its tenants include public broadcasting station KQED - whose signage adorns the top of the tower -еКas well as business consulting firm Accenture, Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, and the Silicon Valley Capital Club.

The Business Journal first reported in early April that 50 West, as the tower is called, had been put on the market. Then, commercial real estate insiders speculated that a sale could fetch $235 million, or about $640 per square foot, potentially breaking price records for the area.

""It's really the top address and it always has been,"" Mark Ritchie, president of San Jose-based Ritchie Commercial, told the Business Journal at the time. ""Whatever price they get will set the new standard.""

The owners have made improvements to the Class A building in recent years, including updating the lobby and opening up the long-abandoned top floor.

""It will show, when it gets sold, that this is now considered a top-tier institutional money market,"" Nick Goddard, senior vice president at Colliers International, told the Business Journal in April. ""This is not risky plays anymore; these are institutional grade investments.""

Across the street, Jay Paul intends to demolish the existing CityView Plaza complex to make way for a 19-story, glass-lined 3.4 million-square-foot mixed-use campus. Though Jay Paul has said it doesn't yet have a tenant in tow for that three-building project, insiders are speculating that the project is designed for a single large tenant, perhaps a company like Facebook or Google, which is moving forward on plans to build a massive, transit-connected campus centered around the nearby Diridon Transit Center.

Jay Paul's bullishness in downtown San Jose

Though notoriously tight-lipped about their specific plans, Jay Paul leaders have talked about their sudden interest in downtown San Jose. The developer had been busy in San Francisco and Sunnyvale but became intrigued by the opportunities in downtown San Jose, Janette D'Elia, Jay Paul Co.'s chief operating officer, said at a real estate event in March.

""There's not a lot of opportunity in other parts of the Valley right now, and Jay wanting to continue to have a very robust pipeline also caused us to push out our sights a little bit farther,"" she said then. ""San Jose came on the radar and once we started taking more time to look at it, we really decided that this would be our next big move.""

San Jose city leaders earlier this year raised building height limits in the downtown core - another bonus for developers with lofty plans. ""We really feel excited that San Jose is recognizing the need for more density downtown and adding the additional height is a way to accomplish that,"" D'Elia said earlier.

The high-water mark for office building sales in downtown San Jose was notched by the late 2017 sale of the twin Riverpark Towers office buildings. In that deal, 50 West's current owners, DivcoWest and Rockpoint Group, were the buyers and paid $283.45 million, or $55.31 per square foot, for the matching 300,000-square-foot buildings on West San Carlos St. and Park Avenue.

HIGHLIGHT:еКVeteran Bay Area developer LBA Realty envisions the development of 1.28 million square feet on stretches of property that front on West Trimble Road and Orchard Parkway in north San Jose.

SAN JOSE - A big new village has been proposed for north San Jose, a development totaling more than one million square feet that would bring office spaces, hotel rooms, and retail uses to this increasingly busy section of the South Bay city.

The proposal from veteran Bay Area developer LBA Realty envisions the construction of 1.28 million square feet on stretches of property that front on West Trimble Road and Orchard Parkway, according to a proposal submitted to city planners.

North Town is what LBA has dubbed the development, according to a brochure circulated by CBRE, a commercial real estate firm looking for tenants for at least a section of the vast project.

The proposal envisions development on 27.7 acres of the property, which has the addresses of 350 W. Trimble and 370 W. Trimble. The development would occur in multiple phases, the brochure and city planning documents indicated.

""It's great to see a more diverse combination of uses proposed for North Town,"" said Bob Staedler, principal executive with San Jose-based Silicon Valley Synergy, a planning consultancy. ""The proximity to the airport is a great amenity as well.""

The site currently contains some industrial and research buildings. Among those are the local offices for Lumileds, which manufactures lighting products. The plans indicate the project would border and retain the Lumileds building.

The first phase of the development would rise on 14 acres on a triangular parcel

at West Trimble and Orchard Parkway.

A 232-room hotel, an office building, a restaurant, and a retail site would be part of the development, the city planning documents show.

North San Jose has become a new boomtown in Silicon Valley recently. Some tech titans have been busy with expansions in north San Jose in recent years - and recent months.

Apple, Google, Samsung, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Micron Technology are among the digital behemoths that have widened their footprints in north San Jose . In recent months, local officials, including Mayor Sam Liccardo, have begun to refer to north San Jose as the Uptown part of the city.

Mountain View-based Google has quietly assembled what would be one of the largest office campuses in the Bay Area with a fresh purchase of several office buildings in north San Jose near the Alviso community.

With its latest acquisition in the northernmost section of San Jose, Google now controls eight big buildings and has cobbled together a vast campus where several thousand of the search giant's employees could work.

Google's latest deals mean the tech titan now has made major commitments for three huge employment hubs in San Jose: the Alviso district of north San Jose, the north San Jose area near the city's airport, and downtown San Jose.

Samsung has established a major regional headquarters on North First Street. Hewlett Packard Enterprise in February began moving into a large office building at 6280 America Center in San Jose where 1,300 people could work. Micron Technology, based in Idaho, has shifted its main Silicon Valley offices to north San Jose.

Cupertino-based Apple, through a combination of property purchases, has assembled 85 acres in north San Jose between North First Street and U.S. Highway 101. The Apple lands are both adjacent to, and across the street from, the North Town project proposed by LBA Realty.

The start date to build the North Town project wasn't immediately clear.

The LBA and CBRE marketing brochure said that future development phases could occur at two other properties on the site. One potential construction area would be at what is now the Lumileds surface parking lot on the south side of West Trimble Road next to the eastern banks of the Guadalupe River. The other development site is along Component Drive between Orchard Parkway and the river.

""This shows the strength of the north San Jose, or Uptown, market,"" Staedler said.",67,,30-May-19,Days Numbered For Beloved San Jose Community Garden Near Google Project,498,East Bay Times,,"Days Numbered For Beloved San Jose Community Garden Near Google Project

SALT LAKE CITY - For millennials looking to buy their first home, the hunt feels like a race against the clock.

In the seven years since the housing crash ended, home values in more than three-quarters of U.S. metro areas have climbed faster than incomes, according to an Associated Press analysis of real estate industry data provided by CoreLogic.

That gap is driving some first-timers out of the most expensive cities as well as pressuring them to buy something before they are completely priced out of the market.

The Salt Lake City area is among the hottest spots for first-time buyers in part because of a staggering burst of home construction and a surge of high-tech jobs. The suburb of Lehi, which served as a film location for the 1984 Kevin Bacon movie ""Footloose,"" about a rural town that banned dancing, is in what is now known as ""Silicon Slopes"" because Adobe, eBay and Microsoft have opened offices there.

Of course, the influx of people from unaffordable cities is contributing to the very problem they were trying to escape: Home prices in the greater Salt Lake City area surged 10.8% in the past year, while average incomes rose only 3.9%, according to figures from CoreLogic and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Scott Robbins, president of the Salt Lake Board of Realtors, sees the price growth as having changed the habits of first-time buyers. They are putting less money down and carrying more debt. And some first-time buyers are looking at condos and duplexes instead of houses.

There is also more pressure on families to earn two incomes, rather than letting one choose to be the stay-at-home parent. This could be a particular challenge in the Salt Lake City area, where families are generally larger, mostly because of the influence of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and about 28% of the population is under 18, compared with nearly 24% nationwide.

""The one thing that really would make it even more sustainable is if wages would increase,"" Robbins said. ""Whereas before you could have a young couple buy a place and only one of them would work. Now, you need both of them to work.""

Andy and Stacie Proctor made a bid on a house in the Salt Lake City suburbs, only to rescind it upon learning there were 13 rival offers. At one point, they almost decided not to buy a house just yet, figuring the bubble was going to burst eventually, said Andy, a 35-year-old who hosts the podcast ""More Happy Life.""

But there was also the opposite risk: ""There is the question about whether it's going to keep going up,"" his 31-year-old wife said.

The couple ultimately made a successful offer on a three-bedroom house for $438,000 in Vineyard, Utah. It includes an apartment that could be rented out to defray their mortgage payments. That will make it easier for them to afford starting a family.

Roughly 1 in 6 homes sold in the Salt Lake Valley since 2004 have been in a 4,100-acre development called Daybreak, being built on land once owned by mining giant Rio Tinto. About 5,500 homes have been constructed, with an additional 14,500 units planned - enough in total to house roughly 65,000 people.

The homes range from $180,000 to $1 million. One of the guiding principles is that homeowners can upgrade or downsize without having to move out of the neighborhood.

But that cycle of upgrading might not continue as it did for past generations. Home values need to rise for people to build equity that they can use to buy a new house. Yet if they rise too fast, it will become too expensive for many people to move up.

Parry Harrison, a 26-year-old divorced father of two small children, bought a townhouse in Daybreak for $309,000 in March. His down payment came in large part from selling his previous home, which appreciated a robust 25% in the two years he owned it. He hopes to upgrade again in five years, when his children might need more space.

""It's definitely not a forever home,"" he said.

By Craig Timberg and Renae Merle | The Washington Post

A leading mortgage settlement and title insurance company, First American Financial Corporation, left hundreds of millions of customer records accessible on the web, including personal information such as Social Security numbers, according to a report on a security blog Friday.

Though no data is known to have been taken, the scale of the security lapse was massive, putting at risk 885 millions records from an unknown numbers of customers, wrote Brian Krebs, of KrebsonSecurity, which covers breaches, hacks and online crime. Based on a tip from a real estate developer who found the vulnerability, Krebs wrote that anybody with access to a web portal for the company could have gained access to documents from other customers by altering digits in the web address.

The tactic, Krebs reported, could have allowed the theft of real estate transaction records dating back to 2003. Such records would reveal a wide range of personal information on customers, including names, bank account numbers, copies of drivers licenses and other information submitted during the mortgage settlement process.

Krebs reported no evidence that the vulnerability had been exploited by hackers, nor was it clear how long the documents had been vulnerable to theft.

First American did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post. Krebs quoted a statement from First American confirming a design defect in an application that made possible unauthorized access to customer data. . . . The company took immediate action to address the situation and shut down external access to the application. We are currently evaluating what effect, if any, this had on the security of customer information.

A real estate developer in Washington state, Ben Shoval, told The Post that he first detected the defect on Monday when he received a title report from First American and followed a link on the document to a public web page.

Three San Jose airport commissioners wont reapply for their positions, claiming that top airport and city officials shunned their feedback on a high-profile policy decision to raise building heights near Silicon Valleys downtown airport.

The terms of Commissioners Raymond Greenlee, Tom Cruz and Mark Schmidt are expiring in June. Commissioners typically get re-appointed with little fanfare. But the trio decided not to come back, citing concerns about being ignored and having no say over major decisions affecting the Mineta San Jose International Airport.

One commissioner said the commission is pointless because its input is rarely solicited or considered by lawmakers, and its merely window dressing  a way to shield officials from resident complaints over aircraft noise.

The city staff and the mayor work directly with airport staff and avoid asking for opinions of the Airport Commission, said Greenlee, whos also a commercial airline pilot. The commission has turned into window dressing for the City Council, so they can say they have an Airport Commission, but they dont solicit nor do they value our opinion. We dont have a say, we dont have veto power  Im not even sure why we have an Airport Commission if the recommendations and opinions arent valued.

Airport leaders, however, say they involved commissioners in the policy discussions about raising building heights and encouraged a robust debate.

Airport spokeswoman Rosemary Barnes said airport officials held two special meetings in January to discuss the plan to raise building heights in downtown San Jose. As a result of those meetings, Barnes said, the commissioners presented their recommendations to lawmakers during committee and council meetings, as well as private meetings.

And minutes from one of those two special meetings shows Schmidt and Cruz were absent.

We believe the Commissioners who chose to attend the individual meetings and panels had the opportunity to share their input both with Airport leadership and directly with Council, participate in the related discussions, and listen to the studys metrics-focused results taken from many City and Airport stakeholders input, Barnes said.

The debate over building taller skyscrapers in San Jose exploded in January after airport officials and city leaders recommended raising building heights by up to 35 feet in the downtown core and up to 137 feet in the Diridon Station area. Five of the commissioners opposed the plan, going against city staff and airport leaders.

While the new height limits met FAA standards, a majority of airport commissioners worried international carriers would leave the airport because taller buildings would force them to reduce weight on their aircraft to pull off emergency landings in certain weather conditions. Theyd likely be forced to remove passengers, resulting in economic losses to the airlines and the possibility of canceled routes to San Jose.

Following an educational forum on the topic hosted by this news organization, the City Council unanimously approved increasing building heights in March.

But the elephant in the room was Google. The decision to build taller came after the tech giant announced plans to develop a mega-campus in downtown San Jose, though city leaders said theyd been eyeing a building height increase for years.

Greenlee said San Jose airport officials studied raising height limits in downtown more than a decade ago, but decided against it because of detrimental impacts on airlines.

They did the exact same study in 2007 and came up with a completely different recommendation, Greenlee said. And now that Google is moving in and everyone has big dollar signs in front of their eyes, airport staff came up with completely different recommendations.

While Greenlee said his decision not to reapply for his position was also influenced by plans to move out of the country, the debate over building heights was the straw that broke the camels back.

Schmidt, who served on the commission for four years, agreed.

Disillusioned is one way to put it, Schmidt said in an interview. If theyre not going to listen to us on this topic  and I dont know if I could ever have another topic as important as this one  why am I spending my time in this capacity? Theres a saying, Dont ask the question you dont want the answer to. They were actively avoiding a robust conversation on the topic.

Airport Commission Chair Dan Connolly, who also opposed building taller in downtown, said hes disappointed to see three of his colleagues go.

Im not sure that the city values the commission system on critical issues, Connolly said.

But Barnes said roughly half of the 11-member Airport Commission overturns every two years. The commission currently has five vacancies, according to the City Clerks website. While the commission is an advisory board, it is meant to study policies and provide expert advice to lawmakers.

We wish Commissioners Cruz, Greenlee and Schmidt well in their future endeavors, Barnes added. They have served us well and we thank them for their service to the Airport and the San Jose community. 2019 Global Data Point.",72,,23-May-19,Google Executives Talk San Jose Development Near Diridon Station,964,East Bay Times,,"Google Executives Talk San Jose Development Near Diridon Station

As it moves forward with building out a large swath of land in San Jose around Diridon Station, Google is vowing not to be just an isolated tech campus, but part of the fabric of the city, playing a key role in addressing homelessness and other concerns.

We decided to come to San Jose because we very much wanted to be part of the city, Alexa Arena, Googles real estate development director, told a gathering of city officials, residents, community organizations and others Wednesday night that also included an overview of how the station itself might be reimagined. We are not here to build a campus in the city.

Without providing specific details of how the Google development  expected to include offices, shops, restaurants and public space  might look, Arena said the project has to be underpinned by social infrastructureits more than about buildings.

Theres so much opportunity here to connect in and grow from our context, she added, noting that San Jose has a rich culture and history from which to draw.

The city is set to review Googles proposed development as it reworks its guidelines for development around the station, which should be completed by the end of 2020. Originally created in 2014, the Diridon Station Area Plan, as it is officially known, needs to be updated. The City Council recently voted to allow taller buildings around the station, and an Athletics baseball park previously expected to be built in the area never materialized.

Before it can break ground, the tech giants project will need to get approval from the City Council and undergo an environmental review. And Google must work out a development agreement with the city, which will include a series of community benefits such as affordable housing or educational resources for local schoolchildren.

Were really focused on creating the right kind of place, said Googles senior director of development, Joe Van Belleghem, designing for the urban experiences that people crave.

But the lack of specifics on Wednesday left some attendees skeptical.

I really have no idea what to imagine, said one attendee.

There were a lot of community members who felt like they were unheard when the city sold the land to Google in late 2018, said Nadia Aziz, with the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley.

And Jeffrey Buchanan, with the labor group Working Partnerships USA, raised concerns about the city moving too fast to adequately address issues like housing displacement and gentrification.

The area around Diridon Station has become one of the hotspots for displacement, Buchanan said. Im just really worried were pushing ahead on this timelinebefore we really understand the impact of the housing issue.

We know we have to be a player in housing and affordability, Van Belleghem said. Were listening and were very excited about entering this next phase.

Google is set to come before the same group  officially the Station Area Advisory Group  later this summer with more specifics, such as where it wants to position different elements, like offices. The company, Arena said, wants to work with and support local businesses and nonprofits that can grow as we grow.

We have to really keep learning and keep reflecting with you all and people in the community, Arena said. Were in for the long haul.

As Googles moves forward with its own project, the city  with partner transportation agencies  is beginning to debate how the station itself should change.

Regardless of how the station design ultimately shakes out, the number of passengers it serves is likely to increase dramatically. Caltrain electrification is already underway, and BART should arrive by 2026. High speed rail could connect to San Jose in the future, too.

Officials say they want a station that makes it easy for people to get from one mode of transportation to another, and to move downtown and into the surrounding neighborhoods easily.

One of the first parts of moving forward with the station redesign will be deciding where exactly the main station should be located, along with where entrances to the forthcoming BART station should be and where buses and taxis should pick up riders. Now, three options are under consideration on where the station should go  San Fernando Street, Santa Clara Street, or Stover Street.

And not everyone is pleased.

A law firm representing the Sharks, who play at the SAP Center on Santa Clara Street, filed a letter in mid-May outlining concerns with putting the station on that street, including the loss of parking lots used by fans and possible gridlock on the road in front of the station entrance.

The resulting losses to the business and goodwill of the Sharks could require payment of tens of millions of dollars in condemnation damages to the Sharks, and could jeopardize the long-term operational success of the SAP Center, the letter read, urging the city to maintain the parking.

But a letter from SPUR  the San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association  argued for the opposite: getting rid of rows and rows of cars near the transit hub and prioritizing access for people who walk or bike instead.

Do not allocate space for park and ride at the multimodal hub, the organization said. Instead, develop a plan for a shared-parking facility in the station area.

The City Council and various agency boards will meet in June, and there will be a couple more community meetings in English and Spanish before a draft is finalized.

As Teresa Alvarado of SPUR noted of the work around Diridon Station and the Google campus, there are so many pieces of this incredible puzzle that have to be addressed.",74,Janice Bitters,23-May-19,Searching For The Crane Truth: What's Happening With Construction In Downtown,908,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Searching For The Crane Truth: What's Happening With Construction In Downtown

New development proposals for real estate projects pour into San Jose's City Hall weekly, many of them tall towers with the potential for hundreds of residential units or architecture plans fit for one of the world's leading tech titans.

Currently, the Silicon Valley Business Journal is tracking nearly 120 projects spanning 90,000 square feet or more in the development pipeline or recently completed in San Jose. Of those, about 43 percent - or 50 projects - are recently completed or have broken ground on one or more phases.

But zooming in on the city's compact downtown, where city leaders envision most of the city's growth in the coming decades, a meager 28 percent of the approximately 40 proposed projects in and around the city's central business district have been recently completed or are under construction. Notably, not a single office building has risen in the city's central business district in about ten years, despite significant business and resident growth in the past two decades.

And while new office space is a key part of downtown's growth plan, city leaders say they want more of everything.

""What we would love to see is really any and all development,"" said Blage Zelalich, the city of San Jose's downtown manager. ""While we are growing, and we've made significant strides since 2000 in terms of doubling the office population and the residential population around downtown, there's still just not enough people.""

Downtown San Jose's current office population sits around 43,000, Zelalich said in an interview last week. But if all of the more than 25.86 million square feet of currently proposed office space in the downtown area were to be constructed, there would be room for four times the current office population in the urban core.

And while that may sound like a lot, downtown real estate gurus say the demand is there.

""All the markets are very tight,"" said Anne Ralston, senior managing director for Newmark Knight Frank who focuses much of her energy on downtown San Jose. ""Let's face it, how long do you think that would take to get built? That is 25 million over five or ten years, and I think that if you were the first one to go up, you would be very successful.""

Meanwhile, about 7,800 residential units are currently in the city's downtown development pipeline, alongside more than 900 hotel rooms. So what is keeping developers from breaking ground? It's primarily cost and certain development rules, according to city leaders, developers and local real estate gurus.

Currently, office space in downtown San Jose is fetching around $4 per square foot on average, according to recent Newmark Knight Frank data. Ralston estimates that number would need to rise to above $4.50 per square foot - or around $6 per square foot for the top-tier, full-service space - before much of the proposed development in downtown will be feasible for many developers.

""It's really just about the economic feasibility of these projects,"" Shawn Milligan, partner with Cupertino-based developer KT Urban, which has several proposed residential and hotel projects in downtown San Jose currently.

""You have to have a return ... that gives you the ability to attract the enormous amount of capital that it takes to build these high-rise projects,"" he said. ""It's really the confluence of a number of factors: It's construction costs, it's regulations and it's city impact fees.""

As construction costs rise due to a busy market and a limited construction labor talent pool, residential rents also haven't kept pace in downtown, Milligan added.

Another factor that has halted some construction has been building heights, says Mark Ritchie, president of San Jose-based brokerage Ritchie Commercial.

""If you had to pinpoint anything that is the reason that downtown San Jose's growth has been so stunted for decades and is so stunted in this hyper boom, it is mostly building heights,"" he said in an interview last week.

Though cities have limited control over factors in the private market, including land prices and construction costs, San Jose city officials have recently made some strides to encourage more projects to get underway. This year, the city council voted to raise building height limits in the city's core and around its transportation hub, Diridon Station, on the west end of downtown. The changes will add millions of square feet that can be built in the city's downtown.

San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo has also laid out several goals for the coming year to try to kickstart construction, including reducing and simplifying fees.

""We can't do anything about business cycles, but we know that development costs right now are keeping a lot of folks from getting shovels in the ground,"" Liccardo said during a Business Journal event earlier this year.

Meanwhile, the city is also working through a revamp of its Diridon Station Area Plan, a zoning and development guide for the land around its transit station where Mountain View-based Google is planning to build a 6 million- to 8 million-square-foot mixed-use corporate campus in the coming decade.

""Those kinds of ... land use policies and development policies are things that are within the city's control,"" Zelalich said. ""Hopefully, we can contribute positively to making more development pencil in the city.""

Representative Ro Khanna Talks Silicon Valley, Initiatives At Stanford At",924,The Stanford Daily: Stanford University,News; Pg. 1,"U.s. Representative Ro Khanna Talks Silicon Valley, Initiatives At Stanford At

Although Ro Khanna (D-CA-17) technically serves parts of Santa Clara County and Alameda County, he has garnered a reputation for being the ""congressman from Silicon Valley"" - the Bay Area's ""man in the middle"" representing the region that houses the corporate headquarters of tech and business giants Apple Inc., Intel Corp., Yahoo, eBay, LinkedIn and Tesla.

Khanna met with journalists from student newspapers across the Bay Area on Saturday, discussing issues ranging from climate change efforts on a national scale down to issues that concern Stanford and Silicon Valley's obligation to responsibly develop technology.

Policy meets digital threats

Khanna showed concern for the potential threats posed by artificial intelligence , concerns he responded to in a resolution (H.R. 531) he and Brenda Lawrence (D-MI-14) introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in February. The resolution, Khanna said, begins to create guidelines for the ethical development of AI, ""making sure that it's not used for discrimination, making sure that there's transparency, [addressing] concerns about facial recognition and making sure we're dealing with displacement and job loss.""

Khanna has also developed a set of principles, which he calls the ""Internet Bill of Rights,"" articulating the rights U.S. citizens should have when they use the Internet, such as net neutrality and control over personal data. He also noted that the progress Stanford has been making with Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence initiatives will be crucial to developing a proper framework.

At this point, the principles are still just principles - they have yet to be attached to certain legislation, which is a goal Khanna is working towards.

""Right now, we first need principles, then we can have legislation that would have the FTC [Federal Trade Commission] be an enforcement mechanism to make sure companies are complying,"" he said.

Khanna sees that there will ""absolutely"" be room for policymakers to interact with people at Stanford and the rest of academia.

Tech expansion and affordability

""We need more affordable housing,"" Khanna said. ""And by that I mean not just for people who are homeless, but for teachers and nurses and others doing everyday jobs. We need to have more housing and rent-controlled apartments that are accessible to people in the middle income [bracket].""

When it comes to balancing affordability with the expansion goals of tech giants like Google - which is trying to develop northern San Jose into a campus of office and industrial buildings and housing units for their workers - Khanna said there ""needs to be a mix.""

""I don't think we should have this district turn into a place only for Google and Apple employees,"" he said. ""On the other hand, I do think have more housing is needed for some of these companies and their employees.""

Khanna added that while it is up to the city government to create balanced zoning policies, he thinks federal grants should be provided to cities that prioritize affordable housing.

Social media and climate concerns

Turning toward online political discourse, Khanna said that a fact-checking mechanism is a ""necessary development"" for a responsible social media platform.

""I don't have all the answers, but I think that [social media platforms] have to put a lot more thought into their obligation as also platforms that carry news,"" Khanna said.

The Internet also poses complications for policy beyond the rise of ""fake news"" and data privacy concerns. Khanna has openly opposed the FOSTA-SESTA package bill, or the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act in the House and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act in the Senate, because it ""criminaliz[es] sex workers and free speech.""

The bill, signed into law by President Donald Trump in July 2018, was designed to curb illegal sex trafficking online. Specifically, FOSTA-SESTA would hold website publishers responsible for third parties posting prostitution and consensual sex work ads. Khanna said the bill was ""overly broad"" in that it also criminalizes consensual sex workers, many of whom visited Khanna at his offices and shared stories of how the bill hurts a vulnerable population.

Khanna also expressed support for Washington governor and Democratic presidential candidate Jay Inslee's ambitious $9.1 trillion climate plan which aims to reach near-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, which Khanna called ""a big, bold action.""

""We need to make the investment that's necessary in solar and wind and renewable energy,"" he said.

Khanna has supported the Green New Deal , a non-binding resolution that died in the Senate in March. It called for the federal government to address climate change by decarbonizing the economy, decreasing reliance on fossil fuels and providing new jobs in clean energy industries.

Khanna called on Silicon Valley to leverage its position as a technology hub to invest in innovative solutions for clean energy - ""whoever wins the clean energy race ... is going to lead the 21st century when it comes to the economic future,"" Khanna said at a South Bay environment forum on Saturday.

Ultimately Khanna expressed his hope that there would be more philosophers and thinkers in Silicon Valley.

""STEM is important, and STEM education is critical to America's economic future,"" he said. ""But so is arts and liberal arts education, and you need a balance of both. It can't be all about the industry, and even the industry's purpose has to be about advancing humanity.""

SAN JOSE  Google has quietly assembled what would be one of the largest office campuses in the Bay Area with a fresh purchase of several office buildings in north San Jose near the Alviso community.

With its latest acquisition in the northernmost section of San Jose, Google now controls eight big buildings and has cobbled together a vast campus where several thousand of the search giants employees could work.

All told, over nearly one and a half years, Google has paid $409.3 million to buy the buildings in north San Jose and now owns a mix of office and industrial buildings in the area that together total 1.27 million square feet.

When innovation economy employers are continually wined and dined by out-of-state Governors and foreign heads-of-state, it is reassuring to witness respected employers like Google double-down on San Jose and Silicon Valley, said Carl Guardino, chief executive officer of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a business organization.

The purchases have occurred in an area north of the interchange of State Route 237 and North First Street, and the buildings front on North First, Nortech Parkway, and Disk Drive.

This infill acquisition will have a long-term beneficial impact to San Joses fiscal health, said Bob Staedler, principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a land use planning and consulting firm.

Googles latest deals mean the tech titan now has made major commitments for three huge employment hubs in San Jose: the Alviso district of north San Jose, the north San Jose area near the citys airport, and downtown San Jose.

Its exciting to see Google continuing to expand in the newly minted Uptown San Jose while planning their efforts in the downtown, Staedler said.

The eight properties consist of five office buildings and three giant industrial buildings. The buildings are so new that at least six have never been occupied.

In the most recent deal, Google paid $137.5 million to acquire three office buildings that together total 332,000 square feet and have addresses of 4550 N. First St., 65 Nortech Parkway and 95 Nortech Parkway, according to official records filed May 15 with Santa Clara County. The deal was arranged by commercial real estate brokerages Avison Young and CBRE.

These come on the heels of Googles purchase, in separate transactions, of building clusters that flank the three buildings.

In January 2018, Google paid $117.3 million for a trio of giant industrial buildings that together total 563,000 square feet. These buildings would be suitable for a unit such as Google Hardware, which includes Nest, a Google organization oriented towards smart homes. These buildings are at 5079, 5087, and 5093 Disk Drive.

In October 2018, Google bought two curving office buildings, located at 4300 N. First St. and 4400 N. First St., paying $154.5 million. These buildings together total 377,000 square feet, a realty marketing sign showed last fall.

Yet Googles shopping spree in north San Jose is far from the only major beehive of activity for the search giant in the Bay Areas largest city.

In downtown San Jose, Google, acting through a partnership with developer Trammell Crow, has spent at least $319.5 million buying an array of properties near the Diridon train station and SAP Center. The purchases are creating a footprint where Google plans a transit-oriented village of office buildings, homes, restaurants, and shops where 25,000 could work, including 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giants employees.

Its good to see north San Jose rebound from the significant office vacancies we have seen in other uptown sites in recent years, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said Friday. Its always encouraging to have corporate buyers of office space.

Whats more, near San Jose International Airport, Google has leased four buildings  three have yet to be constructed  totaling 479,000 square feet that would be part of a vast campus being built by legendary Silicon Valley developers John Arrillaga and Richard Peery. That campus has been approved for as much as 2.03 million square feet of offices.

Some experts believe Google might eventually lease the remainder of the space, or even purchase the entire site at some point.

Googles commitment to innovation and local job creation underscores their commitment to our local communities, Guardino said.",80,Marlize Van Romburgh,17-May-19,Google Grabs More Space In North San Jose And Mountain View,381,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Google Grabs More Space In North San Jose And Mountain View

Google's latest real estate moves follow a package deal the company struck last month with veteran Silicon Valley development firm Peery Arrillaga to simultaneously buy a trio of Mountain View properties for $250 million and pre-lease four buildings at a North San Jose site entitled for millions of square feet of office space.

City leaders earlier this week approved a new plan to fast-track the development of 8,000 new housing units in North San Jose, with 20 percent of those planned as affordable homes.

The city's north side has long been home to some of Silicon Valley's biggest companies, including Cisco Systems and PayPal Holdings. But in in recent years it has become a hotbed of new commercial activity, attracting developers and major corporate tenants alike. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., McAfee, Zscaler, ASML and Micron Technologies and Bloom Energy are among the companies that have leased new campuses in North San Jose as large new projects like The Assembly come online.

Google's North San Jose real estate deals are separate from the large downtown San Jose campus the company has planned around the city's Diridon transit center. There, the company has said it would like to build out a transit-oriented mixed-used campus that could eventually span 8 million square feet and accommodate as many as 20,000 employees.

D1,"Huge Project Next To Levi S Stadium;

Related Santa Clara, one of the largest projects in the Bay Area, plans to create over 9 million square feet of offices, housing, hotels and retail on 240 acres next to Levi's Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers.

Developer Related Cos. intends to start construction next year on the $8 billion project, previously known as CityPlace Santa Clara, which survived dueling lawsuits between Santa Clara and its neighbor, San Jose. The first phase is set to open in 2023.

In a battle over Silicon Valley's future growth, San Jose sued Santa Clara in 2016 and alleged that the project, which includes 5.4 million square feet of office space and 1,680 housing units, would lead to more housing demand and additional traffic in San Jose.

In response to San Jose's lawsuit, Santa Clara sued to block Santana Row, a large office project planned in San Jose. The two cities settled both lawsuits last year, allowing both Related Santa Clara and Santana Row to be built in exchange for payments to both cities to fund transit improvements.

The clash underscored Silicon Valley's growing pains amid the red-hot economy, powered by big tech companies like Google, which plans to build a giant campus in San Jose, and Apple, which leased space in Santa Clara last year. Job growth has far outpaced new housing, with the Bay Area adding 14,900 new homes in 2017 compared to 52,700 jobs, according to government data.

The amount of housing was limited at Related Santa Clara because the site was previously used as landfill and required additional environmental approvals, according to Santa Clara Mayor Lisa Gillmor. She said other parts of the city will add more housing, such as the adjacent Tasman East area, where 4,500 units are planned.

The project will replace an underused golf course at 5155 Stars and Stripes Drive, she said. Legal challenges aren't fully resolved: David's Restaurant, a tenant on the site, is fighting a city eviction and use of eminent domain.

Stephen Eimer, a Related executive vice president, said the developer was attracted to the site because of its proximity to transit from the Santa Clara Valley Transit Authority and Amtrak and Altamont Corridor Express trains. VTA light rail trains will connect to Caltrain stations in Mountain View and San Jose and a soon-to-open BART station in Milpitas. The project website confusingly notes that BART is coming to the city of Santa Clara in 2025. While technically true, that station is 6 miles from the stadium area and will not offer convenient transit connections.

The project will generate $17 million in annual taxes and fees and create 25,000 jobs. It includes 170 affordable housing units. An additional 700 hotel rooms are planned.

Eimer said the project's mix of elements and pedestrian-friendly nature is unusual for Silicon Valley, and reflects the desire of both companies and residents to be near entertainment and food. A new 30-acre public park will also be built.

It will be one of the largest new shopping centers in the region, with 1 million square feet in retail space. Department stores were originally planned, but as consumer spending has shifted online, much of the focus will be on food.

""The vision for retail has changed since they first presented,"" Gilmor said.

The project will include a food market similar to San Francisco's Ferry Building, Eimer said. Restaurant tenants are expected to sign on by early next year.

""We're partners with some of the world's best restaurateurs,"" he said.

The project is reminiscent of Related's biggest project, the $25 billion Hudson Yards in Manhattan, which also includes a mix of housing, office and retail among multiple skyscrapers.

The difference will be height. Hudson Yards' tallest building is nearly 1,300 feet, while Related Santa Clara will rise up to 219 feet above sea level, or about 12 stories.

The project is being designed by prominent architecture firms Foster + Partners, which designed Apple's new circular campus, and Gensler, whose clients include Nvidia and Facebook.",84,George Avalos,15-May-19,Why Safeway Will Close Downtown San Jose Store,566,The East Bay Times (california),,"Why Safeway Will Close Downtown San Jose Store

HIGHLIGHT:еК""There is no question, this is a big loss,"" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said.

SAN JOSE  Safeway intends to shut its store in downtown San Jose within weeks, city officials said Tuesday night.

There is no question, this is a big loss, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said in an interview.

Safeway employs about 40 people at the downtown San Jose store, Wendy Gutshall, a spokeswoman for the supermarket chain, said Wednesday. Gutshall said those employees are expected to be placed in nearby stores.

The soon-to-close Safeway store, at 100 S. Second St., is scheduled to cease operations by June 14, a memo issued by the office of San Jose City Councilman Raul Peralez said. Peralez represents the downtown San Jose area.

We are very sorry to see Safeway close its doors, the city memo said.

The main problem: Free parking vanished for Safeway patrons, despite strenuous efforts by the city to gain ownership of the underground parking garage adjacent to the store.

A government agency that is the successor to the defunct San Jose Redevelopment Agency еКfrustrated the citys multiple efforts to buy the parking garage. As its obliged to do, the successor agency sold the garage to a high bidder, according to government sources.

Eventually, a private investment group bought the garage and jettisoned free parking for Safeway patrons in the form of a store validation. That, in turn, undermined the financial stability of the Safeway store, government sources said.

Despite the citys best efforts, we were unable to maintain public ownership of the garage, Liccardo said.

Rumors had circulated for several months thatеК Pleasanton-based Safeway was considering closing the supermarket. The store is one of the smaller markets for the grocery chain.

The decision to close a store isn't one we make lightly or without a great deal of deliberation, Gutshall said. Like all retailers, we're constantly evaluating the performance of our portfolio of stores, and it's occasionally necessary to close locations that aren't meeting company goals.

Safeway will still have 12 stores in San Jose once the downtown store is closed, Gutshall said.

We recognize the great value that grocery retailers have to our downtown residents and the concerns that arise once Safeway discontinues its operations, the city memo said.

However, a number of grocers are located within a mile of the historic core of downtown San Jose. Those includeеКWhole Foods, Target, Trader Joes and Grocery Outlet.

Whats more, according to the city memo, several ethnic grocers are nearby, such as Santo Market, Cardenas Market, Arteagas Food Center and Nijiya Market.

I will be happy to pick up the phone, do whatever I can to encourage a grocery store, or other retail, for the Safeway site,еК Liccardo said. We recognize how important it is to have grocery services downtown.

The mayor believes residents and workers will increasingly demand additional supermarket and retail options in downtown San Jose.

Chief among those: Google has proposed a transit village near the Diridon train station, while Adobe intends to dramatically expand the size of its downtown campus of three buildings by adding a fourth office tower at an adjacent site.

Potentially 25,000 workers could be added to downtown San Jose in the next several years. All of this points to the potential for dramatic changes in the citys urban heart.

With the resurgence of the downtown, we expect a lot of demand for grocery stores and more retail in the area, Liccardo said.",85,,15-May-19,Silicon Valley Getting Its Own Version Of Nyc's Hudson Yards,936,National Real Estate Investor,,"Silicon Valley Getting Its Own Version Of Nyc's Hudson Yards

(Bloomberg)--The developer of New York's Hudson Yards is ready to build another massive office, housing and retail complex -- this time about 3,000 miles to the west.

Related Cos. announced Wednesday that it has started work on a 240-acre (97-hectare) site in Silicon Valley for what it says is one of the largest entitled developments in California history. Located just north of Levi's Stadium, where the National Football League's San Francisco 49ers play, the Santa Clara project will cost roughly $8 billion, replacing a public golf course that sits atop a former landfill.

The development has long been planned -- Related first announced it six years ago -- and the fact that it's just now getting under way speaks to the difficulties of building in a region that's become infamous for its housing shortage and legal wrangling over growth. But it's also a testament to the robust Bay Area tech scene and demand for space that the company is embarking on a lengthy construction process late into an economic boom.

When fully built, the project will have 5.4 million square feet (502,000 square meters) of offices, 700 hotel rooms, more than 1,600 apartments, and a retail, dining and entertainment district, as well as a 30-acre park -- all a short distance from public transit and adjacent to an industrial area that the city is converting to a residential zone with room for as many as 4,500 units of housing. Related named renowned architect Foster + Partners to lead design of the development's first phases.

By creating an urban area rich with amenities, Related is betting that it'll be able to draw the sorts of corporate tenants that increasingly see such perks as a key to attracting and retaining staff. The development, expected to initially open in 2023, will also feature a range of office types, from loft-style spaces attractive to startups, to a zone that could accommodate a large company's headquarters.

""Room to grow is a big issue in Silicon Valley,"" said Steve Eimer, Related's executive vice president in charge of the project. ""Most of these companies want to put their flag down in a place where they don't have to move.""

Whether a sleek master-planned community becomes more than just a playground for wealthy tech employees remains to be seen. Related's Hudson Yards development -- a $25 billion mega-plex of office towers, residences and shopping areas built over former rail yards -- has been met with similar criticism. The New York Times called it ""Manhattan's Biggest, Newest, Slickest Gated Community.""

'Better Use'

In general, creating authentic urban experiences is very difficult in an area that's developed all around the same time, said Margaret O'Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who's studied the history of Silicon Valley. Even so, she said, Related's development is clearly ""better use of land than a golf course"" in a region that's starved for housing.

Some of the residential units at the property will be earmarked for people making less than 120% of the area's median income, Related said. And, in a first for Northern California, the developer will be allowed to build housing on a site that used to be a landfill.

While Related is funding preliminary work at the site, Eimer said the developer will likely bring in some outside capital for the project. The company partnered with Oxford Properties Group, an arm of Canadian pension fund OMERS, to help build Hudson Yards.

""You want investors who have the same mentality that you do, which is for a long-term hold,"" he said. ""A large pension fund would be an ideal partner.""

Beyond housing, demand for office space is strong, particularly among the tech companies that fuel the Bay Area's economy. Over the past two years, Facebook Inc. went on a real estate binge, leasing space in San Francisco and in the East Bay, while expanding its headquarters in Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, Google parent Alphabet Inc. has been working toward developing a large new campus in San Jose.

All the activity has pushed office-vacancy rates in Silicon Valley down to about 10% in the first quarter, compared with 15% a year earlier, according to data from brokerage Newmark Knight Frank.

""This is almost an unprecedented run of growth,"" said Newmark Executive Vice Chairman Phil Mahoney, who's worked in Silicon Valley for more than three decades and is helping Related lease the new Santa Clara development. ""We're in 10 years-plus of running a strong economy locally.""

Resistance to new development in the bedroom communities of Silicon Valley can be fierce, with residents often pushing back on plans to add more density to single-family areas. Related's project was held in limbo for more than year because of a fight between the city of Santa Clara and neighboring San Jose, which squabbled over the impacts on traffic and housing. The two cities reached a settlement last year that's allowing work to move forward.

Santa Clara Mayor Lisa Gillmor said Related's project delivers on a longstanding vision to transform the northern part of her city into a ""tourist, business and entertainment district."" The project is expected to bring in about $17 million a year to local coffers from lease payments, taxes and fees when open.

""I'm really proud of what we've done,"" Gillmor said. ""The money from this project is going to fund our police, our fire department, our parks -- for the next 100 years.""

The cause of government transparency finally broke through to the popular zeitgeist this year. It wasn't an investigative journalism expose or a civil rights lawsuit that did it, but a light-hearted sitcom about a Taiwanese American family set in Orlando, Florida, in the late 1990s.

In a January episode of ABC's Fresh Off the Boat, the Huang family's two youngest children, overachievers Evan and Emery, decide if they sprint on all their homework, they'll have time to plan their father's birthday party.

""Like the time we knocked out two English papers, a science experiment, and built the White House out of sugar cubes,"" Evan said. ""It opened up our Sunday for filing Freedom of Information requests.""

""They may not have figured out who shot JFK,"" Emery added. ""But we will.""

The eldest child, teenage slacker Eddie, concluded with a sage nod, ""You know, once in a while, it's good to know nerds.""

Amen to that. Around the world, nerds of all ages are using laws like the United States' Freedom of Information Act (and state-level equivalent laws) to pry free secrets and expose the inner workings of our democracy. Each year, open government advocates celebrate these heroes during Sunshine Week, an annual advocacy campaign on transparency.

But the journalists and researchers who rely on these important measures every day can't help but smirk at the boys' scripted innocence. Too often, government officials will devise novel and outrageous ways to reject requests for information or otherwise stymie the public's right to know. Even today - 20 years after the events set in the episode - the White House continues to withhold key documents from the Kennedy assassination files.

Since 2015, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (a nonprofit that advocates for free speech, privacy and government transparency in the digital age) has published The Foilies to recognize the bad actors who attempted to thwart the quests for truth of today's Evans and Emerys. With these tongue-in-cheek awards, we call out attempts to block transparency, retaliation against those who exercise their rights to information, and the most ridiculous examples of incompetence by government officials who handle these public records.

The Corporate Eclipse Award: Google, Amazon, and Facebook

Sunshine laws? Tech giants think they can just blot those out with secretive contracts. But two nonprofit groups - Working Partnerships and the First Amendment Coalition - are fighting this practice in California by suing the city of San Jose over an agreement with Google that prevents city officials from sharing the public impacts of development deals, circumventing the California Public Records Act.

Google's proposed San Jose campus is poised to have a major effect on the city's infrastructure, Bloomberg reported. Yet, according to the organization's lawsuit, records analyzing issues of public importance such as traffic impacts and environmental compliance were among the sorts of discussions Google demanded be made private under their non-disclosure agreements.

And it's not just Google using these tactics. An agreement between Amazon and Virginia includes a provision that the state will give the corporate giant - which is placing a major campus in the state - a heads-up when anyone files a public records request asking for information about them. The Columbia Journalism Review reported Facebook has also used this increasingly common strategy for companies to keep cities quiet and the public in the dark about major construction projects.

May 10: Cleveland Scene: Perfect Ways To Celebrate Mother's Day in Cleveland That Aren't Brunch

This Sunday is Mother's Day, and instead of scrambling for last minute floral arrangements or trying to squeeze your way into an overcrowded restaurant for brunch, Cleveland has plenty of other creative ways to celebrate the person who brought you into this world. Bottomless mimosas are pretty damn awesome, but this year, give your mama something new to get excited about.

Stay Curious at the Great Lakes Science Center Your mom taught you how to read, tie your shoes, and wipe your own butt.

May 09: Cleveland Scene: CLASH Lawyers Up, Demands that City Accept Lead Safe Petitions

In a letter filed yesterday, Cleveland Lead Advocates for Safe Housing (CLASH) demanded that Cleveland Law Director Barbara Langhenry compel city council clerk Patricia Britt to accept the 6,350 signatures that CLASH submitted last month with the hopes of putting a lead-safe ordinance on the November ballot.

Those signatures were rejected by council because the petitions failed to include an all-caps disclaimer about election falsification required by the Ohio Revised Code.

CLASH has maintained, and reiterated in its letter to Langhenry, (attached below), that the City Charter, not the Ohio Revised Code, dictates the local government response. It has cited numerous legal precedents, including the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in the Q Deal referendum dispute, to argue that Britt must accept the petitions, regardless of their form or substance.

""If there had ever been any doubt,"" the letter states, ""the Supreme Court's decision in [the Q Deal case] makes clear that the Clerk must accept the petitions and perform her duties in determining the sufficiency of the signatures.""

Sebastiao Salgado, a Reality of the World in Black and White Sponsored Content by

The letter was signed by attorneys Marc Dann and Donna Taylor-Kolis, from the Dann Law Firm, whom CLASH has retained as legal counsel.

""Our hope is that the Council Clerk and Law Director will do the right thing so that we can avoid the time and expense of seeking a Writ of Mandamus,"" said Dann, in a statement provided to the press.

CLASH said that if Langhenry refuses to compel Britt to accept the signatures and refuses to file a Mandamus action in court to force her hand, then CLASH would do so itself, a procedure that it says is allowed under state and local laws.

Just like in the Q Deal case, CLASH has officially requested that they be named defendants in any Mandamus action against Britt so that they can present material to the court.

This legal action runs parallel to the Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition (LSCC) effort.

For a new promotion, Clevelanders are welcome to bring these signs to SVD offices (5620 Broadway Ave.) to receive a free cone coupon from Daisy's Ice Cream.

Community engagement coordinator Joseph Linsky says these companies prey on at-risk home owners to get properties cheaply.

March 13: Cleveland Scene : Plain Dealer News Guild Wants to Launch Subscription Drive In Bid to Save Jobs

In another attempt to retain local union jobs in the face of expected layoffs, members of the PD News Guild have asked the Plain Dealer Publishing Company to collaborate with them on a subscription drive.

In a letter sent Tuesday, to which the company has not yet officially responded, the Guild asked that for every 500 new subscriptions purchased, one local journalist's job be preserved for an additional year.

With expected support from local unions, including the member unions that comprise the North Shore Federation of Labor, the News Guild asked that a discounted rate be offered to ""unions, retirees and supporters.""

This tactic is an about-face from last month, when local unions joined with the News Guild in a pledge to cancel subscriptions and boycott cleveland.com stories, if necessary, to support their union brothers and sisters.

The subscription drive plan, however, allows the company and the union to ""unite as partners - rather than as adversaries - to keep more watchdogs and storytellers employed.""

Given how the company has responded to Guild bargaining requests in recent weeks, it's unlikely that the letter will be met with support or good faith. (The company's goal is to employ less of them, ultimately.)

Sunday, editor George Rodrigue took to the PD to celebrate the power of local investigative reporting - in a column, incidentally, that has not yet appeared on cleveland.com. He repeated an argument that he has made at community meetings: that investments in watchdog journalism yield enormous financial benefits for communities because of prudent changes in policy that the reporting effects.

The letter was a companion piece to a national report from the Associated Press (see image above) about the death and strangulation of small newspapers across the country.

""Blame revenue siphoned by online competition, cost-cutting ownership, a death spiral in quality, sheer disinterest among readers or reasons peculiar to given locales for that development,"" the AP reported.

March 07: Cleveland Scene : No One Told Us the Frank Jackson ""Briefings"" Would Be Videos With Such Tender Musical Accompaniment

As promised, Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson has released the first in what has been billed as a regular series of ""briefings"" to keep residents apprised of what's going on at City Hall.

But we had no idea these briefings would be in video form! Nor could we have anticipated that they'd be accompanied by such soft and soothing strings. (We note the guitar in the frame's background and humbly request that if Jackson plays, he do so in the next briefing.)

These briefings, Jackson says, will ""really get into the details of how we're, and why we're, doing something.""

In this introductory message, he reprises one of his greatest hits, explaining the function and purpose of city government - ""We're not a for-profit corporation. We're not a non-profit corporation,"" - and provides some examples of what he's been up to lately: budget hearings, training trauma coaches at city rec centers, and preparing to unveil the new city kennel.

March 04: Cleveland Scene : Hearings on a Federal Lawsuit Challenging Ohio's GOP-Drawn Congressional District Maps Began Today

A battle between the American Civil Liberties Union, the League of Women Voters, Democratic Party groups and others and the state of Ohio commenced today in U.S. District Court over the state's GOP-drawn congressional districts.

The plaintiffs are arguing before a three-judge panel in Cincinnati that the way the state draws its congressional districts unfairly devalues the votes of minorities and others who generally vote Democratic because the process allows for gerrymandering, or designing districts with political advantage in mind.

Ohio's current congressional map was drawn by a Republican-controlled panel in December, 2011. From 2012 to 2016, Republicans in Ohio won 56 percent of the state's votes for U.S. House candidates. But they netted 75 percent of Ohio's seats in the House. In 2018, that pattern repeated, with Democrats getting only four of the state's 16 seats.

That's because many of the state's congressional districts are drawn so that races in them aren't competitive, groups like the ACLU say. Instead, large numbers of reliably conservative voters are concentrated in districts like Ohio Congressional District 1, which encompasses the west side of Hamilton County and deep-red Warren County. U.S. Rep. Steve Chabot has held that district since the 1990s, save a brief exception in 2009, when Democrat Steve Driehaus defeated him for a single term just before the districts were redivided.

February 28: Cleveland Scene : Case Western Reserve University Names Actor and Activist LeVar Burton the 2019 Inamori Ethics Prize Winner

An American actor, director, producer and writer who's worked in show business for more than 40 years, LeVar Burton also advocates for children's literacy and AIDS research and treatment.

This fall, the Inamori International Center for Ethics and Excellence at Case Western Reserve University will award the 2019 Inamori Ethics Prize to Burton for his ""outstanding global ethical leadership as an advocate for such important and worthy causes.""

""I couldn't have been more surprised by the news,"" Burton says in a press release announcing the accolades. ""This is a very prestigious honor, and as the first recipient from the field of the arts, I look forward to being able to accept the prize and thank the committee in person.""

Burton will be awarded the prize and deliver a free public lecture about his work as part of an academic symposium and panel discussion during Inamori Center events that take place on Sept. 19 and 20 on the Case Western Reserve campus.

""I'm delighted to have LeVar Burton as our first prize-winner from the Arts,"" says Shannon E. French, Inamori Professor in Ethics and director of the Inamori International Center for Ethics and Excellence. ""His work for children's literacy has had such profound impact. He has truly transformed lives through PBS's Reading Rainbow and his nonprofit work. And he has also been a change agent in support of more funding for AIDS research. Beyond these enduring contributions, as an actor he made the world confront the inhumanity of slavery with his searing, unforgettable performance as Kunta Kinte in Roots and helped us all imagine a better, more just future as a star of Star Trek: The Next Generation. He's a wonderful example of what it is to be an ethical leader in the arts, and I know he will inspire our students and our community.""

Burton also hosted Reading Rainbow, a children's program launched in 1983 on PBS to foster and inspire a love of reading.

SANTA CLARA  A big office complex in Santa Clara has been bought by a realty firm with ties to China in a deal that shows how a robust tech sector has bolstered sturdy investor interest in Silicon Valley.

Central Technology Park in Santa Clara, which has undergone a wide-ranging facelift by the seller in the deal, legendary developer The Sobrato Organization, was bought by Gemini Rosemont.

Acting through an affiliate, Gemini paid $170.5 million for the complex, according to Santa Clara County property documents filed May 9. Bank of America provided a $98.5 million loan to help finance the purchase, the records show.

The addition of Central Technology Park to our portfolio underscores our ongoing investment strategy to acquire Class A office assets in targeted U.S. locations, which include Silicon Valley, said Ian Brownlow, chief executive officer with Los Angeles-based Gemini Rosemont.

The deal shows that an array of buyers, including purchasers with backing from overseas companies, hunger for quality assets in Silicon Valley, where a boom led by big tech industry players is under way.

The buyers in the deal have been very persistent in trying to find quality assets in the area, said Eric Fox, an executive managing director with Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm. They had been looking for a while.

The 396,000-square-foot Central Technology Park consists of four large office buildings within an area thats roughly bounded by Central Expressway, Corvin Drive, Kifer Road, and Copper Road.

The complexs tenants include Intuitive Surgical, Nissan, Thermo Fisher, and Cloudinary. The most recent major lease in the development came early this year when Intuitive Surgical, a top player in advanced medical equipment, leased 210,000 square feet in a deal arranged by brokers from commercial realty firms JLL, Newmark Knight Frank and CBRE.

The buyer of the office park, Gemini Rosemont, was formed in 2015 as a partnership of Gemini Investments, a Hong Kong-based unit of Sino-Ocean Group, a Chinese real estate investment company, and Rosemont Realty.

The commitment to the area by the world's technology community coupled with the institutional quality, fully-leased multi-building campus makes Central Technology Park an extremely attractive investment, Gemini Rosemont CEO Brownlow said.

The newly bought Central Technology Park is relatively close to the Caltrain stop at Lawrence Station in Sunnyvale and nearby, hundreds of residences are being developed or in the pipeline.

Experts believe investors will continue to slake their thirst for properties in Santa Clara County.

The desire to be part of the Silicon Valley market remains strong, Fox said.

Among the factors: Digital behemoths such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Adobe, and LinkedIn have grabbed expansion sites in Silicon Valley through a head-spinning series of property purchases, mega leases, or both.

This is still a very hot investment market, said Julie Leiker, Cushman & Wakefield market director. The demand for space starts at the top with the big players. As long as the large tech companies keep expanding, the rest of the spaces will be taken by smaller companies, and this will keep going.",88,Rose Meily,10-May-19,Homeownership Matters' Is Realtors' Legislative Day Theme,700,The Mercury News (california),,"Homeownership Matters' Is Realtors' Legislative Day Theme

HIGHLIGHT:еКMembers of the Silicon Valley Association of Realtors joined about 2,500 California Realtors in Sacramento on May 1 for the California Association of Realtors annual Legislative Day.

Members of the Silicon Valley Association of Realtors joined about 2,500 California Realtors in Sacramento on May 1 for the California Association of Realtors annual Legislative Day. This year's theme, Homeownership Matters, was evident in the speeches of Realtor officials and politicians, and in the discussions the Realtors had with their respective legislators.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, the special guest speaker at the C.A.R. morning briefing, said California is experiencing a ""crisis moment, a crisis of confidence, and a crisis of affordability.""

Newsom is deeply committed to addressing the housing issue. Instead of 100,000 housing units a year, he wants to build 300,000 to 400,000 units on an annual basis.

The Governor also noted he is for growth and inclusion. California is a universal state which practices pluralism and ""people should not just tolerate each other; they should celebrate each other.""

""Let us not forget that we are better off when were all better off,"" said Newsom.

At a luncheon with members of SILVAR and neighboring Realtor associations, State Senator Scott Wiener, author of SB 50, the Housing Development Incentives bill, said todays zoning laws, crafted more than 50 years ago, are outdated. It is necessary to pass his legislation because ""it's about people and people's lives.""

SB 50 would authorize transit-rich housing project bonuses for new urban developments, so families can afford to live within the communities in which they work. ""Housing is not a punishment. Housing is where people live,"" said Wiener.

In the afternoon, Silicon Valley Realtors met with state Senators Jim Beall and Jerry Hill, and Assembly Members Marc Berman and Evan Low, all staunch proponents of housing. They thanked the Realtors for their support and advocacy. Berman praised the Realtors, saying they form a powerful contingent advocating for housing.

Berman has introduced AB 302, which will require colleges to identify safe lots and facilities for homeless students to use. He said the state has about 700 homeless students per community college. He acknowledged the bill is a band-aid to the housing crisis, but ""for now, it is a realistic band-aid while we figure out how to create and make sure there's a roof for everyone.""

Beall said he is proud of the passage of his bill, SB 3, a $4 billion bond to help military veterans purchase homes with low or no down payment at below-market interest rates and pay for housing development programs. He spoke about bills he has currently in committee, like SB 5, which would make financing available for construction of affordable housing. Beall said SB 5 would be a major housing finance bill in the state Senate, which would finance actual housing projects. Another bill, SB 6, would look at all state properties that could be available for affordable housing and create a statewide data base where developers can see where to build, so cities can see where affordable housing can go.

Beall balked at excuses given by some cities time and time again for not building more housing.еК""Theres always something. They dont care about overcoming those issues,"" Beall remarked.

Low said he has received sharp, mean-spirited backlash from those who oppose his pro-housing stance, some even demanding his recall, but he is not wavering. ""Oftentimes we need to speak truth to the powerful. I feel very strongly about this. It's important to make courageous decisions,"" said Low.

The legislators called on Realtors and others to stand up and speak louder about the need for housing ""because the other side is so loud.""

""We need to change the narrative; we cant talk among ourselves. We need to elevate the conversation,"" said Low.

The $110 million sale of roughly 11 acres of public land is subject to radical change by Google. The sale was unanimously approved by the San Jose City Council on Dec. 5, 2018.

This change has the possibility of bringing in 20,000 to 25,000 new jobs to San Jose.

Joe Pereira, 44, is a general contractor and has lived within a mile of Diridon Station for about nine years.

""I like the idea. I thought about it before I knew the whole idea, even the neighbors who bought it after they like the idea,"" Pereira said. ""This whole area, downtown needs a boost. I've lived in San Jose my whole life. I think it would be a boost of economy.""

In an area currently ruled by vacant industrial buildings and parking lots, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo called the sale an important ""first step.""

Liccardo said during a press conference that Google will help the city achieve a vibrant mixed use of development, meaning more businesses and stores.

The community willеК see change to the area surrounding Diridon Station in the future.

According to Google's proposal to the City Council, the company has plans that involve turning the areas surrounding Diridon Station into homes, hotels, offices, restaurants and retail stores.

Jonathan Deo, 36, works for the County of Santa Clara and has been living in his home within a mile of Diridon Station for about four years.

""It's probably going to bring in more congestion,"" Deo said.еК""I am hopeful that whoever does work at the Google complex does live in the area, because I think there's a lot to be said for folks having investment in the community for which they work.""

He continued, ""San Jose's downtown core has really needed to be revitalized for a long time. There can be positive and negatives to this whole thing.""

However, there are also skeptical community members who believe this mega deal with Google will displace thousands ofеКSan Jose residents in the surrounding areas of the new development, according to Serve the People.

Serve the People is a grassroots group comprised of migrants, immigrants and workers looking to keep out future exploitation.

""Is rent to increase? Possibly. Only 15% of San Jose is zoned for commercial use, the rest is residential. We need jobs,"" said San Jose public information manager Elisabeth Handler.

There are concerns that the build will send home prices soaring and push vulnerable people out of the city.

Sandy Perry, president of the Affordable Housing Network of Santa Clara County, said in an interview with San Jose Spotlight, ""Google should end homelessness in San Jose and then ask to come in.""

The city council meeting did not go smoothly, starting with around a dozen protesters chanting and delaying the meeting for around 45 minutes.

Eight protesters who chained themselves to their seats were removed from the meeting by police and were released the next morning.

The Spartan Daily reported that the protesters held up a sign that said ""Googleville,"" chanting, ""say it loud, say it clear, Google you are not welcome here,"" and ""We won't be displaced, we won't be erased.""

After peacefully being escorted out of the council chamber, city council members deliberated about plans for the Diridon Station for more than eight hours.

They came to a unanimous decision to work with Google in order to expand the city.

This would not be the first time the large company has made changes to city development.

According to the Public PressеКin March of 2017, the Mountain View City Council approved Google's plan to construct a two-level 595,000 square-foot office building, and remove 196 heritage trees on its 18.6 acre Charleston East Campus.

The company also agreed to build 10,000 homes and apartments in the area nearby.

On March 12, San Jose City Council approved taller building codes for the Diridon Station area where buildings may increase their height from 70 to 150 feet, making more room for Google's urban development.

According to a city-commissioned study, a height increase would dramatically boost the city's revenue.

With the current plan generating $8.5 million

in annual revenue tax, taller building codes would bring in $12.5 million to the City of San Jose, said San Jose economic development director Kim Walesh.

Currently, no construction has been started for ""Googleville,"" but Google is developing a plan for the buildings for the city council to approve in the next year.",92,,30-Apr-19,San Jose Council Member Sent Packing By Housing Crunch,1025,East Bay Times,,"San Jose Council Member Sent Packing By Housing Crunch

A San Jose politician and his family now have first-hand experience with the Silicon Valley's crazy housing market.

Councilmember Raul Peralez says he and his wife and their six-month-old son and two dogs were evicted from their rental home of nine years in early April.

The family lived in a three-bedroom single family house for $2,400 and hoped to find something similar but ended up in a $3,000 two-bedroom townhome, according to San Jose Spotlight.

""When we got the notice, as we were looking for places, it was stressful and really depressing to see how many limited options there were for us. Nothing was showing up,"" Peralez, who formerly worked as a police officer and a substitute teacher, told San Jose Spotlight.

He added: ""Almost every single advertisement that we saw said, 'Close to the new Google campus. I think that's a common theme all throughout my district now, whether it's a for-sale place or for-rent. It's a real effect of development by Google even though the project is not built yet.

Internet2 issued the following news release:

* * *

- Secure, private, dedicated connection offering available to AWS Direct Connect, Google Cloud Dedicated Interconnect, and Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute

* * *

Internet2 announced the general availability of its Cloud Connect service which provides direct access to leading commercial cloud providers through the existing regional and national infrastructure at no additional cost. The offering is available to higher education institutions, affiliate members of Internet2, and regional and state networks, and follows a successful 16-month pilot phase that included the engagement of over 50 university campuses and 20 regional research and education networks.

""One of the big lessons learned in the past few years about cloud migrations was the importance of the network that handles the cloud payload,"" said David Marble, CEO of OSHEAN, Inc. ""With the Internet2 Cloud Connect service, regional and state networks like OSHEAN now have an architecture to keep member cloud traffic within the research and education domain, thereby offering the opportunity to optimize performance and resiliency, reduce cost, automate provisioning, and provide analytics.""

The Cloud Connect service offering makes it easier for researchers to access and use cloud resources, and is part of a larger effort under the Internet2 Next Generation Infrastructure program that aims to deliver a full set of solutions to support science, collaboration, the academic enterprise, and the ever-present migration to the cloud across the research and education community.

The Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is using the Cloud Connect service to enable experiments on a testbed that extend into public clouds. RENCI develops and deploys data science cyberinfrastructure that helps researchers in academia, government, and business use data to drive discoveries, innovate, make informed decisions, and spur economic development.

Their projects use the Cloud Connect service in a research and education network configuration with the aim of simplifying hurdles for researchers to access direct public cloud connections and enable a wide array of cloud experiments. Through the service, RENCI will automate the deployment of layer 2 circuits across the Internet2 Cloud Connect service using the ExoGENI1 network orchestration testbed. This effort will leverage the advanced software-defined networking capabilities of the Chameleon testbed to enable experiments spanning National Science Foundation research cyberinfrastructure and public clouds.

""As campuses explore cloud as a way to accelerate scientific discovery and expand academic IT services, research and education networks have a big role to play in enabling that migration,"" said Rob Vietzke, vice president of network services at Internet2. ""Research and education networks are already trusted partners in big science and academic IT because of the transparency, security, and support they bring to campus collaborators. The partnership of research and education regional networks and Internet2 to bring Cloud Connect to the campus doorstep as part of our existing services is yet another value-add to our unique partnership in enabling the research and education ecosystem.""

The Cloud Connect service provides institutions with a Cloud Connect Portal for researchers and campus IT staff to deploy shared direct connection infrastructure on their own with the ability to support private direct connections to AWS Direct Connect, Google Cloud Dedicated Interconnect, and Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute.

Through this portal, regional and state networks and campus subscribers can quickly gain access to 200 gigabits per second of private peering capabilities to these major cloud providers through the Internet2 Network in four cities across the country, including Ashburn, Virginia; Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; and San Jose, California.

In addition to the Cloud Connect service, Internet2 provides more than 800 gigabits per second of public peering capacity through its Internet2 Peer Exchange (I2PX) service for institutions that do not require a private network connection into the cloud.

""As a consortium for education and research, Southern Crossroads (SoX) facilitates national and global collaboration between higher education and research institutions through high-speed, global connectivity and other commodity services,"" added Cas D'Angelo, president of SoX. ""The Internet2 Cloud Connect service enables the ease of configuration and access to leading cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure - maximizing opportunities for high-performance computing, machine learning, data analytics, and enterprise service offerings. SoX participants reap the benefits of easily connecting to multiple platforms through one scalable, secure, integrated solution.""

The Cloud Connect service offering is part of an integrated, organization-wide strategy at Internet2 to provide cloud solutions that are developed in alignment with its member community across the research and higher education community. Internet2 is participating in a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation to build partnerships with commercial cloud computing providers and support science applications in new and more effective uses of cloud computing capabilities through the Exploring Clouds for Acceleration of Science (E-CAS) project.

Internet2 also provides cloud solutions through the Internet2 NET+ program, a portfolio of cloud solutions specifically tailored by and for higher education. The program fosters deep collaborations with cloud service providers to shape technical requirements, products enhancements, ensuring identity and access management standards, and improving support for the InCommon Federation.

Together, these advanced, resilient, secure, community-driven services make it easier for researchers to access and use cloud resources to enable their day-to-day work.

Lafayette: Lafayette City of California has issued the following new release: With a wave of new development -- from a massive Google campus to new Adobe towers -- set to arrive in San Jose in the coming years, the nation's 10th largest city has set new downtown design guidelines that aim to give it a ""more human centric"" feel.  Initially created more than 10 years ago, the guidelines have been updated and now spell out everything from how signage should be placed -- perpendicular, so pedestrians can see it -- to where parking structure entrances should be located -- not near pedestrian building entrances. Taken one by one, the updates seem relatively minor.

But all together, they signal city leaders' desire to make San Jose more walkable, more visually interesting and generally more urban.  ""We want the city to be cool,"" Mayor Sam Liccardo said, ""more human centric.""  While the guidelines are tied to strict building rules and regulations, some are softer suggestions meant to give developers and others a more predictable, clearer sense of what the city wants and is likely to approve. The city's director of planning, building and code enforcement -- currently Rosalynn Hughey -- also will now have the authority to make ""minor"" updates to the guidelines.  ""We're trying to retrofit a city built for automobiles into a city built for people,"" Liccardo said.  But the changes have left some groups concerned. Environmental groups like the local Audubon Society and Sierra Club are worried the guidelines could allow developers to build with reflective materials harmful to birds, and the historical landmarks commission fears they will permit new buildings to dwarf and overwhelm historic structures.  ""If you want to build a beautiful city there are many ways to do that without killing birds,"" said Shani Kleinhaus, with the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society.  The council agreed Tuesday to have staff do more outreach and get more feedback from developers and others about bird-safe design.  ""We have already seen current proposed projects such as the Boston Properties' Woz and Almaden project and Adobe Tower 4 project taking voluntary steps to incorporate bird safe features in their design,"" Councilman Raul Peralez wrote in a memo. ""While we are fortunate that these two major projects along the riparian corridor have taken the initiative to promote conservation in their design, we may not be as fortunate in the future with other developments.""  The guidelines, which take effect mid-May, will apply to new projects and major exterior modifications in the area between Interstate 280 north to Coleman Avenue and Diridion Station east to San Jose State University. In the past, Liccardo said, ""the idea was you had to build these fortresses...That thinking has changed dramatically.""  Now, the guidelines call for design that fosters connection and easy transport across barriers such as creeks or roads. Long, uninterrupted facades will be discouraged.

SAN JOSE  BlueJeans Network, an up-and-coming cloud-based meetings company, has struck a deal to shift its headquarters to Santana Row in San Jose, the latest tech company to move its head offices to the Bay Areas largest city.

The company has subleased a big chunk of space in the 500 Santana Row building in San Jose, agreeing to occupy 40,000 square feet of offices that currently are leased to another technology firm, Splunk, according to BlueJeans officials.

Through the deal, BlueJeans will exit a 24,000-square-foot, 46-year-old industrial building on Clyde Avenue in Mountain View and move its headquarters to Santana Row.

San Jose has a rich history in Silicon Valley, and Santana Row is a very attractive location for several reasons, said Robert Park, chief financial officer with BlueJeans Network.

BlueJeans Network is a meetings platform and the first cloud service to connect desktops, mobile devices and room systems in one video meeting. BlueJeans has raised $175 million in funding, according to Crunchbase. The privately held company also has reached the benchmark of $100 million in annual revenue, BlueJeans said.

Park added that the factors making Santana Row enticing include lots of new construction with state-of-the-art features and technology, dozens of nearby restaurants and shops, close proximity to highways 280 and 880, and downtown San Jose. Pak noted that the SAP entertainment and sports complex and Avaya Stadium are also nearby.

Developed and owned by Federal Realty, Santana Row is a mixed-use retail, restaurant, office, nightlife, hotel and residential complex that has become an iconic Bay Area destination andеК appears to be a magnet for tech companies.

Splunk, whose software seeks out, collects and analyzes an array of data, has leased the entire 235,000-square-foot office building at 500 Santana Row and all of the 310,000-square-foot office building at 700 Santana Row, part of a major expansion of its San Jose operations. But while it gradually expands its South Bay footprint, Splunk is offering sublease spaces in both buildings.

BlueJeans subleased the second floor of the 500 Santana Row building, at the southeast corner of South Winchester Boulevard and Olsen Drive, according to Newmark Knight Frank brokers Armand Tiano and Luke Allard, who represented Splunk in the deal. Cushman & Wakefield broker Matthew Chatham represented BlueJeans in the sublease transaction.

Separately, Splunk is offering for sublease 150,000 square feet of office space at the nearby 700 Santana Row building, Allard said. The 315,000-square-foot 700 Santana Row building, which Splunk leased in 2018, is still under construction and will be a gleaming curved building when its complete. Splunk expects to move in by mid-2020 and will steadily increase its footprint after it takes occupancy, Allard added.

BlueJeans Network intends to move into its second floor offices in the 500 Santana Row building sometime this summer, the company said.

BlueJeans also noted that San Jose offers the potential for even more office space, with plenty of development proposals in the works or projects under way. Among those projects is Googles transit-oriented community of proposed office buildings, homes, stores, restaurants and parks near downtown San Joses Diridon train station.

There is a tremendous amount of development happening in San Jose, with a future Google campus and other tech development, Park said.",103,Svbj Staff,24-Apr-19,Video Conferencing Company Bluejeans To Move Hq To San Jose's Santana Row,543,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Video Conferencing Company Bluejeans To Move Hq To San Jose's Santana Row

Video conferencing company Blue Jeans Network Inc. is moving its headquarters from Mountain View to San Jose's Santana Row, the Mercury News reported Tuesday. There, the company will take almost twice as much space as it currently occupies at its office on the Peninsula.

The company, which brands itself as BlueJeans, will vacate its current 24,000-square-foot headquarters at 516еКClyde Ave. in Mountain View and instead will sublease 40,000 square feet of office space on the second floor of 500 Santana Row from Big Data software company Splunk, which last year expanded its Santana Row footprint with a major lease at the development next-door.

""A large percentage of our employees live in the South Bay, so this will be a welcome reprieve in commute times for most,"" BlueJeans CFO Robert Pak told the Mercury News.

Cushman & Wakefield broker Matthew Chatham represented BlueJeans in the deal, the Mercury News reported, and Newmark Knight Frank brokers Armand Tiano and Luke Allard represented Splunk.

""There is a tremendous amount of development happening in San Jose, with a future Google campus and other tech development,"" Pak told the Mercury News.

The company has raised $175 million in venture funding and was valued at about $728 million after a September 2015 funding round, according to PitchBook. Its key investors include New Enterprise Associates, Accel, Norwest Venture Partners and Wing Venture Partners.

BlueJeans' competitors include Zoom Video Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), the fast-growing downtown San Jose-based video meeting company that went public last week and now has a market valuation of nearly $17 billion on the Nasdaq.

It also competes against Cisco Systems Inc.'s WebEx conferencing product and Microsoft Corp.'s Skype.

The building at 500 Santana Row is one of the properties that Splunk occupies at developer Federal Realty Investment Trust's bustling San Jose retail and office development.

In 2015, Splunk became the first major office tenant to sign a full-building lease at the development. Last year, it expanded by taking another 300,000 square feet at neighboring 700 Santana Row, the newest office in the development. The company is also offering 150,000 square feet of office space in that building for sublease, which it expects to move into by mid-2020, Allard, one of the brokers involved in the deal, told the Mercury News this week.

Santana Row today is home to about 690,000 square feet of office space, including 700 Santana Row, 500 Santana Row, a third office building at 300 Santana Row as well as other mixed-use buildings, according to Federal Realty.

All told, Santana Row has about 2 million square feet of commercial and residential space, 50 different retailers, 30 restaurants, a 215-room boutique hotel, a 7,000-square-foot fitness center and more than 830 residential units. Federal Realty last year brought a spate of new retailers and restaurants to the shopping center and started to move forward on additional projects the mall, which sits across the street from another popular shopping destination, Westfield's Valley Fair.

The redevelopment of the Davidson Building in downtown San Jose has taken two big turns: It reportedly is switching from residential to office use for its redo, and it's attracted Gary Dillabough to its development team.

The prominent building at 255 W. Julian Street, just off State Route 87, was built in 1984 and would become an office tower that would range in size from 600,000 to 700,000 square feet, according to a report Monday in the Mercury News. That would be a significant increase from the current Class B building's 56,415 square feet.

That's a 180-degree shift from a vision unveiled more than a year ago, when developers Tony Arreola and Mark Lazzarini filed plans to erect twin 18-story residential towers at the site. The envisioned project on 1.8 acres would have included 653 market-rate units, about 10,000 square feet of ground-level commercial space and underground parking for 654 vehicles.

Now, the plan is to put offices in that space to take advantage of the site's location between Mineta San Jose International Airport and Diridon Station, the area where Google is planning a massive new campus.

""Given our Valley's job growth and market demands for office space in downtown San Jose, changing our proposal from housing to office makes a lot of sense because it complements all of the housing being built next to our property,"" Arreola told the Mercury News. ""Having an airport and a major transit center within a few minutes from our property, makes our office tower extremely appealing.""

Joining Arreola and Lazzarini in the project is Dillabough, the prolific real estate investor behind the Bank of Italy Building renovation and the Valley Title site overhaul. Also involved in the project is Charles Davidson, the owner of the eponymously named building that's set to be replaced.

""This project would be at a very important, prominent location,"" Dillabough told the Mercury News. ""It's at a gateway for downtown San Jose.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКSan Jose City Council should protect families and seniors who rely on affordable housing

The proposal by Mayor Sam Liccardo to weaken San Jose's Ellis Act Ordinance puts nearly 150,000 tenants at greater risk of displacement and poses a serious threat to the city's dwindling supply of rent-controlled affordable housing. On May 7, the City Council will decide whether to protect the families and seniors that rely on this housing, or whether to support the developers and investors seeking to make money by tearing it down and rebuilding.

San Jose first passed its Ellis Act Ordinance in 2017, after hundreds of tenants were evicted when the Reserve Apartments were demolished, the largest such displacement in California history. The purpose of the ordinance is to preserve rent-controlled apartments. It disincentivizes their demolition by requiring at least half of new units built on their sites to be rent-controlled. San Jose's ordinance is already weaker than those of most other cities, which typically require 100 percent of the new units to be rent-controlled.

Liccardo first presented his proposal to study this issue on Feb. 5. He said he was ""concerned"" that not enough developers were bringing forward plans to demolish old rent-controlled buildings and build new ones in their place. Liccardo admitted that these kind of projects would force the families living there to ""go live somewhere else,"" but apparently thinks that this is not too high a price to pay to help him meet the affordable and market-rate housing goals he proclaimed in 2017.

Tenants who gathered recently on April 4 at City Hall Plaza disagreed. Rose Wallis, a single mother of three, vehemently objected, relating the dire hardships that she had endured several times due to forced relocations.еК Ramon Navarro Johnson complained that tearing down these apartments would force the existing renters - like him - to have to move, while the expensive new housing built in their place would be for new people, like future Google employees. ""The citys vision doesnt appear to include the poor, who are mostly people of color,"" he said.

All tenants who spoke agreed that Liccardo's plan discriminated against minority tenants and created special hardships for single-parent households. According to Housing Department reports, San Jose residents in rent-controlled apartments are 49 percent Latino, 34 percent Asian, and 5 percent African American. These are the people who would be targeted for removal if the Liccardo plan is approved.

San Jose is already suffering a soul-crushing displacement crisis, even before the projected arrival of Google and several other commercial mega-projects that are in the pipeline. Displacement as a policy is condemned by virtually all urban policy advocates, due to its severe negative impacts on economic opportunity, diversity, culture, family, community, environment, and quality of life.

The problem of direct and indirect displacement was without question the primary community objection raised during the various hearings held on the Google mega-campus project in 2018. As a result, the city committed to study and address displacement as part of the Memorandum of Understanding process it adopted in December when it sold its land to Google. Repeatedly during the hearings, city staff referred to its Ellis Act Ordinance as a sign of the city's seriousness about stopping displacement. To hear the mayor now propose to change the ordinance and force families to ""go live somewhere else"" is disheartening and feels like a betrayal.

We call on City Council to protect our people and reject this proposal. The mayor states that the decision on this issue should be simply ""data-driven"". Nothing could be farther from the truth. This is about the hopes and fears of living and breathing human beings.

Jay Paul Co. on Friday revealed some of the highly anticipated details of its plans to redevelop CityView Plaza, a block-long mixed-use office park in the heart of downtown San Jose.

Plans submitted to the city on Friday show the San Francisco-based developer intends to demolish the existing complex on the site to make way for a 19-story, glass-lined 3.4 million-square-foot mixed-use campus on the site. The three-building project would include five levels of underground parking.

""The new design for the 300,000 square-foot site will be aеКnew landmark that will act as a catalyst for growth, invigorating the heart of downtown San Jose,"" according to a statement from architecture firm Gensler, which is designing the project.

The plans and renderings come after months of speculation over what sort of massive development Jay Paul Co. would put together for a key site in the middle of San Jose's growing downtown. Notably, the renderings appear to span across the entirety of the block, even over the small portions of the property the company doesn't yet own.

Jay Paul Co. has a reputation for making high-quality buildings that draw some of the largest tech giants in the world as tenants, including Google, Facebook, Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp.

Indeed, Mark Ritchie, president of longtime San Jose-based commercial real estate brokerage Ritchie Commercial, was wowed by the designs Friday. The development, he said, will undoubtedly be transformative for downtown San Jose, just as CityView Plaza (formerly known as Park Center Plaza) was when it was developed in the 1970s by veteran developer Lew Wolff.

""What's incredible about it is that block was the cornerstone of the earliest redevelopment efforts in downtown San Jose,"" he said. ""This will be the biggest thing in downtown, as was Park Center Plaza when it was built, but what is daunting about it is demolishing buildings that are in perfectly good service today.""

Jay Paul Co. purchased the plaza last summer for $283.5 million and shortly thereafter began negotiating with tenants in the approximately 600,000-square-foot complex to end existing leases and move companies out.

A few months later, the management team overseeing the complex confirmed that it would be redeveloped, but didn't release any information about what would rise.

Last month, Janette D'Elia, Jay Paul Co.'s chief operating officer and Phil Mahoney, a veteran Silicon Valley broker that has long worked with Jay Paul to lease its massive redevelopment projects, shed some new light on why the company is bullish on the city and its vision for the site during a luncheon at a Commercial Real Estate Women (CREW) Silicon Valley event in San Jose.

Though rumors have swirled for months that there is already a tenant lined up for the property, both D'Elia and Mahoney shrugged off the claim during the event, saying it was too early to speculate about who the tenant or tenants would be.

On Friday afternoon, Mahoney confirmed again that no leases had been signed, but was optimistic about the project's potential.

""I think Jay's stable of tenants speaks pretty well for itself,"" he said. ""I think it will be someone of that magnitude.""

D'Elia said at the event last month the city's of San Jose's recent decision to raise the maximum building height limits in the city's downtown would be a boon to the project.

In the downtown core, where Jay Paul is looking to redevelop CityView, buildings will be able to rise about 35 feet taller than before. In the Diridon Station area, where Google is envisioning a new 6 million- to 8 million-square-foot mixed-use campus, buildings will be allowed to rise 150 feet taller than before. In all, San Jose's downtown will see as much as 8.6 million square feet more development potential as a result of the new building height restrictions.

Jay Paul Co.'s proposal is easily one of the largest office projects proposed in downtown San Jose.

""It definitely wasn't in the underwriting, but it's a definite plus, and we're going to be taking advantage of it,"" D'Elia said of the building height change. ""We really feel excited that San Jose is recognizing the need for more density downtown and adding the additional height is a way to accomplish that.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКMillions more are being invested in downtown San Jose with the official completion of the San Jose Armory purchase, public records filed on Thursday show.

SAN JOSE  Millions more are being invested in downtown San Jose with the official completion of the San Jose Armory purchase, public records filed on Thursday show.

A group led by up-and-coming developer and realty investor Gary Dillabough paid $3 million for the historic armory, located at 240 S. Second St., according to documents filed with the Santa Clara County Recorders Office.

Dillabough is planning something special for the building, whose construction in 1933 was bankrolled by one of the innumerable federal grants the government issued in a quest to ward off the Great Depression.

The two story building includes offices and an assembly hall where soldiers drilled during World War 2.

A theater, a museum, the best bookstore in the world, something that would be special could be among the uses for the building, Dillabough said in an interview this week.

A ballet, dance, gymnastics, or other sort of school could also be the tenant for the 19,000-square-foot property, experts said.

The sellers were trusts headed by Frederick Sharkey and Rita Cortez, the county documents show.

Mr. Sharkey has been using the building to make sets for local theater productions, Dillabough said.

In downtown San Jose, property purchases by Dillabough-led groups include wide-ranging renovations of the iconic and historic Bank of Italy office tower, a facelift for the old Bank of the West building, a redevelopment of the Museum Place office and retail site that will also expand The Tech Museum, along with a dramatic project for the Lido Nightclub site, as well as a million-square-foot office and retail development at the Valley Title property near Second and San Carlos streets.

Dillabough said this week that his investment groups have bought 17 downtown San Jose properties.

The San Jose Armory deal is a reminder that investors, large and small, developers and tech companies have begun to thirst for development and investment sites in downtown San Jose.

Google has bought numerous properties near the Diridon train station; Adobe intends a dramatic expansion of its downtown headquarters campus. Tech companies are opening offices or seeking expansion sites downtown.

What separates Gary Dillabough from some of the developers and investors of the past is he has more of the biggest picture about what it will take to elevate downtown San Jose, said Bob Staedler, principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a land use and planning consultancy.

Dillabough said hes interested in more than renovations of office buildings in the citys urban heart. He said he also seeks to create a great user experience in downtown San Jose.

Its one thing to have only a dollars and cents short-term view, Staedler said. Staedler added, referring to Dillaboughs approach: To actually have a long-term vision about downtown San Jose is refreshing.",112,,18-Apr-19,"Google Readies Big North San Jose Expansion, Buys North Mountain View Buildings",820,Miami Herald,,"Google Readies Big North San Jose Expansion, Buys North Mountain View Buildings

SAN JOSE  The San Jose Armory, a historic downtown building that was constructed eight decades ago, has been bought by a group led by one of the busiest developers in the Bay Areas largest city.

Gary Dillabough, an active downtown developer and realty investor who is studying an array of options to revive the old Armory with unique new uses, has struck a deal to purchase the building thats located at 240 N. 2nd St. in San Jose.

Its a beautiful building, Dillabough said. Its one of the prettiest buildings in downtown San Jose.

Terms of the purchase werent disclosed.

We really want to do something special with this building, Dillabough said.

The construction of the San Jose Armory in 1933 was bankrolled through one of numerous federal grants that were issued during the Great Depression.

Completed in 1934, the building was one of the armories owned by the states California Army National Guard, according to a post on the Military Museum website.

The Military Museum site also stated the San Jose Armory is deemed to be a significant historic resource because of its association with World War II, its connections with the state-owned armories of the early 20th century and its architectural style.

The armory is essentially a two-story assembly hall set behind a two-story office wing, the Military Museum site stated. The armory is constructed with board-formed concrete and has Spanish Revival stylistic details.

During World War 2 and in other periods, the building was used for military drills.

A number of unique uses come to mind for the 19,000-square-foot building, Dillabough said.

A theater, a museum, the best bookstore in the world, something that would be special, Dillabough said. It could be a school because its so close to St. James Park.

A Bay Area property expert agreed that the future uses of the building will be anything but commonplace.

Its an unusual and unique site, said Mark Ritchie, president of San Jose-based real estate firm Ritchie Commercial. Just as an event space alone, the Armory has a lot of promise. Its got some real beauty to it. A one-of-a-kind and interesting use will come along for it.

In downtown San Jose, Dillaboughs property purchases and investments include wide-ranging renovations of the iconic and historic Bank of Italy office tower, a facelift for the old Bank of the West building, a redevelopment of the Museum Place office and retail site that will also expand The Tech, along with a dramatic project for the Lido Nightclub site, as well as a million-square-foot office and retail development at the Valley Title property near Second and San Carlos streets.

Dillaboughs investments have become sufficiently numerous that more than a few of them are clustered closely.

The Bank of Italy Building, Bank of the West, Fountain Alley sites, and Lido building are adjacent to each other or separated by only a few hundred feet in the area of First and Santa Clara streets; the Armory site is just around the corner from prior purchases by Dillabough led-groups at 152 N. Third St. and 227 N. First St.; and in the South First Area, or SoFA entertainment and dining district, Dillabough ventures are involved with the old Camera 12 site, the Jose Theatre and the Valley Title property.

We have 17 properties in downtown San Jose, Dillabough said, referring to the number of sites purchased by his ventures.

Ritchie believes Dillaboughs investment efforts have far from run their course in downtown San Jose.

People need to understand that what Gary and his partners are doing are not everyones cup of tea, Ritchie said. These are high-risk, high-expense ventures that would really not be happening without their risk capital. He is taking on a lot of difficult buildings.

Still, Dillabough himself suggested that he might slow the pace of purchases by his various ventures. Thats because realty prices have risen in downtown San Jose.

Among the factors: Google has bought numerous properties near the Diridon train station; Adobe intends a dramatic expansion of its downtown headquarters campus. Large, medium-sized and small tech companies are opening offices or seeking expansion sites downtown; big developers such as Jay Paul, Boston Properties and TMG Partners have crafted development plans and property purchases.

Even so, Dillabough clearly has far-reaching hopes and dreams for the San Jose Armory complex.

We want to create a great user experience in downtown San Jose, we want to do more than office projects, Dillabough said.",115,,17-Apr-19,"Commercial Real Estate Exclusive: Google, Veteran Silicon Valley Developers",605,San Francisco Business Times,,"Commercial Real Estate Exclusive: Google, Veteran Silicon Valley Developers

The owner of a prime swath of land near San Jose's Diridon Station has opted to put the 2.19 acres up for sale, advertising the city's new taller downtown building height limits rather than the 123 homes that have long been approved for the property.

Park Delmas Investors LLC, associated with San Jose-based developer Robson Homes, on Monday announced its intent to sell the property at the Northwest corner of Park and Delmas avenues.

The property sits in the Park Delmas neighborhood, less than half a mile from the busy Diridon Caltrain station, where Alphabet Inc.-owned Google is working on plans to develop a new, massive mixed-use corporate campus. The site is also part of a newly qualified Opportunity Zone.

""The 2.2-acre site is well positioned to be an influential and transformative part of the continued build out of the Diridon Station Area,"" Dominic Boitano, senior project manager for Robson Homes, said in a statement. ""Google has already announced its intentions to grow here, and the city recently took actions to raise building height limits, opening up a lot of possibilities.""

Indeed, the city of San Jose's downtown has been stunted when it comes to building tall towers due to its proximity to Mineta San Jose International Airport. But in March, elected leaders unanimously opted to raise the allowed height limits in downtown - and particularly around Diridon Station - after a recent study showed the changes would have a limited impact on airlines and could be a major boon for economic development.

In all, the change will allow about 8.6 million square feet of additional development to rise in and around the downtown core from what was allowed prior to the March 12 vote.

""We recognize that all the investments we're making in transit, all the ambitions we have for a vibrant downtown - all of it depends on actually having density in our core,"" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said as the council voted to raise the height limits last month.

The property that Robson Homes has put up for sale has held entitlements since 2016 for a mixed-use development that could reach four- and five-stories high, bringing with it 123 attached residential units in two buildings. That approved project was set to come with an approximately 1,000-square-foot cafМ© on the ground level alongside a leasing office, a lobby, clubhouse and fitness center and about 22,000 square feet of open space.

Those approvals have sat unused for years and now, it seems, won't likely come to fruition unless a new owner opts to move forward the mid-rise development proposal. Under the new height limits, a proposal could reach as high as 300 feet, according to marketing materials for the site.

In the years since those plans were submitted to the city, downtown San Jose has seen robust change, not only in the raised building height limits and form of Mountain View-based Google interest in the previously overlooked South Bay city, but also in renewed developer and investor interest.

The Business Journal has counted more than 24,500 residential units proposed for development in recent years throughout San Jose, as well as more than 3,800 hotel rooms at various points in the pipeline.

As much as 31 million square feet of potential commercial office, retail, warehouse and industrial space has also been proposed across the sprawling city, according to Business Journal research, though none of that potential new office space is currently under construction in downtown.

Even so, Robson Homes is advertising the potential for a big development on its site on the west side of the city's downtown. Scott Selke of Integrated Capital Management, John Leyvas of Newmark Knight Frank and Andre Hunt of The Helen James Company are marketing the property, according to a statement Monday.

""This is a key downtown property in a great neighborhood, and a project here could change the skyline of San Jose,"" Boitano said. ""We are excited to see how the marketplace responds to such an important site.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКPoll shows significant support for ""strong mayor"" style of government, which is standard in big U.S. cities.

San Jose is one of California's last major cities whose mayor has largely ceremonial authority and must often defer to the city manager, who oversees departments like police and fire, roads and parks, libraries and planning.

But a new poll obtained by the Mercury News and sponsored by a business group suggests voters are ready for a change to a big-city style ""strong mayor"" with executive authority to run the city and the power to veto city council decisions.

If approved by voters, San Jose would join San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles and San Diego in vesting the authority of its council-appointed city manager with the mayor, a move the city's business and labor political factions have resisted over the years out of fear it would empower their rivals.

""A strong mayor system would turn over significantly more power to the current or any future mayor, especially in a mayor's relationship with the city council,"" said Garrick Percival, a political science professor at San Jose State University. ""The presence of a mayoral veto tips the balance of power directly to the mayor.""

San Jose is among just a few major cities, such as Dallas, with the manager-council government more common in small suburban cities where part-time council members appoint and approve policies for a full-time city manager.

Commissioned by the Silicon Valley Organization and conducted by FM3 Research, the poll found that 68 percent of respondents initially supported the idea of a strong mayor ballot measure. After hearing positive messages about the idea, that figure rose to 75 percent and after opposing messages, it fell to 71 percent.

Regardless, such a ballot measure would need just a simple majority to pass, a good sign for backers of the idea.

The poll, which surveyed 400 people by landline and cellphone between March 12 and 18 and has a sampling error margin of 4.9 percentage points, also found that the current mayor, Sam Liccardo, has a 65 percent favorable and 14 percent unfavorable rating. It's a figure likely influencing the level of support for a strong mayor style of government, with respondents imagining Liccardo in the role.

""That's robust,"" Terry Christensen, a professor emeritus at San Jose State, said of the level of support for a strong mayor form of government. ""If you put this out at the end of [former mayor] Ron Gonzales' term, you'd likely get very different results.""

When initially asked, District 2 respondents, low-income voters, Democratic men, South Asian and East Indian voters, Democrats under 50 and liberal Democrats were most likely to support an elected mayor over an appointed manager handling key government functions.

Seven in 10 Democrats and independents surveyed would support the measure compared with slightly fewer than six in 10 Republicans.

For proponentsеКinterested in placing such a ballot measure on the 2020 ballot, the poll results are good news, although it's still too early to tell whether voters will be asked to decide the issue anytime soon. Only about 10 percent of respondents said they would definitely oppose such a measure.

Under a strong mayor system, a mayor would have more power to appoint people to top positions at City Hall and the ability to act more swiftly. That, Percival said, could be useful in emergency situations like the 2017 Coyote Creek flood that devastated parts of San Jose.

""The mayor himself couldn't declare an emergency to get resources flowing faster,"" he said. ""That's a power that currently resides in the manager's office.""

But making the switch could also make City Hall even more political.

""The pendulum swings from labor to business would be huge,"" said Bob Staedler, a principal at the consulting firm Silicon Valley Synergy.

Such volatility could add a level of uncertainty around land use decisions, labor policies and other issues. And if the city makes the switch anytime soon, that volatility would come as developers and companies like Google are buying up and redeveloping parts of downtown, and as the city plans major projects, like the expansion of BART and the overhaul of Diridon Station.

If the city ended up with a mayor who wasn't a competent administrator, that could cause problems.

""That's the chance you take,"" Christensen said, pointing out that lots of cities try to minimize risk by having a chief administrative officer who doesn't have as much authority as a typical city manager but could run the day-to-day bureaucracy.

But there's also a chance voters wouldn't notice major changes.

""We've been edging in this direction,"" Christensen said, noting that in San Jose, the mayor has had the ability to propose a budget since the mid-1980s, which isn't the norm in manager-council cities.

That may be part of the reason that San Jose has held onto its current government structure for so long, Christensen said.

""It's kind of been working for us,"" he said.

Still, Christensen thinks it's time to move to the strong mayor system.

""In general, I'm a proponent because it provides leadership and greater accountability, and those things are crucial to making a system work.""

The poll also surveyed likely voters in San Jose on a number of other topics.

In addition to polling Liccardo's favorability rating, the survey asked likely voters about former Vice Mayor Madison Nguyen and state Senator Jim Beall, two names that have surfaced as possible contenders for Liccardo's seat when he terms out in 2022. Thirty-seven percent of respondents had a favorable view of Nguyen, 48 percent didn't have an opinion and 15 percent had an unfavorable view. For Beall, 36 percent had a favorable view, 52 percent didn't have an opinion and 13 percent had an unfavorable view of the senator.

HIGHLIGHT:еКCohesity, a tech firm that provides cloud-based data storage services, has leased 60,000 square feet in the RiverPark Towers complex of two office high rises, which are perched alongside the banks of the Guadalupe River on West San Carlos Street.

SAN JOSE - Cohesity, a fast-expanding technology startup, has decided to widen its footprint dramatically in downtown San Jose by agreeing to lease enough space for hundreds of new workers in the urban core of the Bay Area's largest city.

The San Jose-based tech firm, which provides cloud-based data storage services, has leased 60,000 square feet in the RiverPark Towers complex of two office high rises, which are perched alongside the banks of the Guadalupe River on West San Carlos Street.

That's potentially enough space for about 300 Cohesity employees, or even more.

With the new 60,000-square-foot lease, Cohesity took three floors in RiverPark Tower. Cohesity was already leasing 99,000 square feet in five floors in RiverPark Tower 2.

The new rental deal was arranged through Newmark Knight Frank brokers Phil Mahoney, Anne Ralston, Mike Saign and Joe Kelly.

""This major expansion reflects the increasing demand generated by many tech brands and their growing employee base,"" said Ralston, a senior managing director with Newmark Knight Frank. ""We were able to meet Cohesity's specific needs by structuring a deal ideally suited for their growth cycle.""

Some huge tech companies such as Google and Adobe are actively laying plans for major expansions in downtown San Jose that would collectively create thousands of new tech jobs.

But smaller tech firms such as Cohesity also have been able to find fertile ground for expansion in downtown San Jose.

""We are loving it in San Jose,"" said Jenni Adair, a Cohesity spokeswoman.

The Cohesity growth efforts in downtown San Jose are part of an overall expansion of the company worldwide.

""We are planning to nearly double the size of Cohesity to 1,500 employees within a year,"" Paul Whitney, chief people officer with Cohesity, said in December.

The RiverPark towers complex is now 97 percent leased, according to Newmark Knight Frank. Among the new tenants: WeWork, the co-working giant, formally moved into its offices spaces in one of the RiverPark towers in February.

The new offices for Cohesity, in both towers, have been geared to appeal to the skilled tech workers the company seeks to retain and recruit.

With a central courtyard between the two towers, along with sweeping vistas of the Santa Clara Valley, as well as the riverside setting, the development is akin to a high-rise campus in the urban setting of downtown San Jose.

The towers are near the San Jose Center for the Performing Arts, San Jose Convention Center, SAP Center and the Diridon train station.

""This project has all the amenities tenants require in one of the hottest spots for tech in Silicon Valley,"" Ralston said.",121,Rachel Swan,7-Apr-19,Bart Isn T Yet On Track;,1411,The San Francisco Chronicle (california),Main News; Pg. A1,"Bart Isn T Yet On Track;

The blue Milpitas sign gleams over 19 acres of former industrial hinterland - once a truck yard and storage facility, now a vacant steel-and-glass BART station waiting for trains to roll in.

It's the first stop in a Silicon Valley extension that Bay Area residents have wanted for decades, connecting the East Bay to tech jobs and cutting through downtown San Jose, where Google is planning a huge new campus. Sixteen miles of track would loop west and then north to wind up in Santa Clara, fulfilling BART's long-standing dream of building out its map in the South Bay.

But the project, already a year overdue, is facing a complication: BART and the Santa Clara transit agency developing the extension haven't agreed on how to fund the line once a sales tax expires in 23 years.

""Beyond that - well, that's what the conversation is,"" said BART Board President Bevan Dufty. He abruptly canceled a joint meeting of the two agencies last month because they were still bickering over financial details.

BART Assistant General Manager Carl Holmes, who is participating in the discussions, said ""we think we're very close"" to resolving the issue.

Talks between BART and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority have dragged on for weeks, as staff craft an operating and maintenance agreement their board directors must sign before opening the first phase - from Warm Springs to Milpitas and on to San Jose's Berryessa neighborhood. During a recent board meeting, officials said it could begin service as soon as November, but now both agencies say it will open by the end of the year.

""The two primary challenges in any negotiation are about money and control,"" said San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo. ""We're working hard, and we're hugging it out.""

Meanwhile, BART is waiting for Valley Transportation Authority to finish testing the system and turn over the keys so that BART can begin its own tests. That has to happen by June for the stations to open on time, Holmes said.

Commuters are getting restless.

""The day before yesterday, I was in downtown San Jose, and my next meeting was in Oakland,"" said Adina Levin, a Menlo Park resident who heads the advocacy group Friends of Caltrain. Levin spent an hour and a half taking a bus from the South Bay to Warm Springs BART, then riding the train to Oakland - the speed and seamlessness of a single train would have been helpful, she said.

The marriage between the two agencies sometimes looks like a collaboration, and at other times resembles a battle of egos. It's a territorial expansion for BART and a point of pride for VTA, as reflected in the architecture. Stained glass glimmers from Milpitas Station, designed in a curved pattern to resemble the Diablo Foothills. Berryessa Station includes a ""contemplative"" garden.

Because Santa Clara County decided not to join the BART district when it formed in 1965, the county was left on its own to build the new track and stations and then pay BART to operate them. Officials would rely on a combination of fares and an eighth-of-a-cent sales tax that the county began collecting in 2012. Yet the tax expires in 2042, and it's impossible to predict whether voters will approve a replacement.

The discussions have an eerie precedent that nobody wants to repeat. In the late 1990s, BART partnered with the San Mateo County Transit District to build a five-stop line down the Peninsula to San Francisco International Airport. SamTrans agreed to pay for operating costs, predicting the agency would recoup all the money in fares. Yet when the airport line opened in 2003, it drew only about half of the 50,000 anticipated daily customers, leaving a deficit of $18.4 million that first year. And the costs kept piling up.

In 2007, BART and SamTrans parted ways. Their divorce settlement gave BART custody of the line, plus $56 million in state infrastructure bond money and 2% of the annual proceeds from San Mateo County's half-cent sales tax, which helped pay for the track to Warm Springs in the East Bay.

That bad memory hovers over the current negotiations to stretch BART into San Jose, said Santa Clara City Councilwoman Teresa O'Neill. As chair of the VTA, she's closely monitored the discussions.

""I heard BART had a divorce with San Mateo County, and I'm told that may be coloring this a bit,"" O'Neill said. ""And we don't want that. We want a long, happy marriage.""

One thing that BART and Santa Clara have going is a better prenuptial agreement. Unlike its Peninsula neighbor, Santa Clara built the tracks and stations itself. It assumed all financial risk - if the extension flops, the only harm BART would suffer is to its public image, because its logo is painted on the train cars. Another factor that could boost the project's success is Google, which could add up to 20,000 jobs - the company encourages workers to use trains and buses, rather than drive. Whereas the San Mateo County line vastly underperformed, some consultants say that the Silicon Valley BART line could exceed ridership expectations.

A native of Santa Clara, O'Neill has waited an entire lifetime for BART to reach the South Bay, reversing the urban planning decisions of the 1960s, when San Mateo and Santa Clara counties opted to build expressways instead of mass transit.

""The decision was made not to join the BART district, and then the county built an expressway system,"" she said.

The new BART line would accelerate the next transformation, which is already under way in Milpitas. Developers will add 7,500 housing units around the still-empty station, where mammoth structures of wood and rebar line a once-empty skyline. It adjoins the Great Mall - a shopping and transit center on the site of a former Ford assembly plant - as well as the VTA's light-rail line.

With so much of the region's future hanging in the balance, officials are tiptoeing around the contract talks. Santa Clara transit officials say they are confident that one-eighth cent sales tax, combined with fares from an anticipated 23,000 weekday riders, will be enough to cover the cost of operating the extension. Yet they've also offered to supplement that money with funding the county receives from the state Transportation Development Act, which would otherwise go to road maintenance and regional mass transit in Silicon Valley.

Even so, uncertainty clouds the negotiations. BART hasn't yet worked out a fare structure for the new line or decided whether to add a surcharge when riders cross the border between Alameda and Santa Clara counties - similar to the fee BART charges to enter San Mateo County or to travel through the Transbay Tube. Eventually, both transit boards will have to approve the operating and maintenance agreement, and some directors won't sign on until they've read the document and can stand by every line.

""I wouldn't sign an agreement unless I was given ample opportunity to read it,"" said BART Director Debora Allen, who represents central Contra Costa County.

During a recent tour of Milpitas Station, officials from BART and the VTA bowed their heads when asked about the operating agreement. Some financial issues still have to be resolved, said Valley Transportation Authority spokesman Jim Lawson, but Holmes declined to provide specifics. Both said the agencies are building consensus around the sales tax funding plan, with Transportation Development Act funds as a backup.

Other challenges loom in the second phase of the project, expected to break ground next year with opening targeted for 2026. Chief among them is the tunnel design beneath downtown San Jose. While the first 10-mile segment is either elevated or at street level, the second segment will burrow underground. The two agencies agreed to a single-bore construction method, rather than the more invasive twin bore with tracks running side by side.

The single-bore plan presupposes that trains would run one atop the other - similar to a double-decker freeway - but several board directors insist on laying tracks side by side anyway. That places a heavy engineering demand on the VTA.

It's ""in the early stages of being studied for feasibility,"" said project spokeswoman Bernice Alaniz.

O'Neill was optimistic, standing on a pedestrian bridge that crosses Capitol Avenue, connecting the empty BART station to the VTA light rail.

""We certainly don't want to tell the public we aren't going to open because we can't agree on operating things -"" she started, until Lawson cut her off.

""- And that's not going to happen,"" he said.",122,Levi Sumagaysay,5-Apr-19,Google's External Ai Council Is No More,440,The East Bay Times (california),,"Google's External Ai Council Is No More

HIGHLIGHT:еКControversial ethics advisory board -- which included Heritage Foundation president -- was formed less than two weeks ago.

Google has disbanded its controversial external AI ethics advisory board less than two weeks after it was formed.

Earlier this week, more than 1,200 Google employees started a petition urging Google to remove Kay Coles James, president of the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, from the Advanced Technology External Advisory Council. Outside academics and tech experts signed onto the petition, which called into question her inclusion on a board that was to consider ethical issues related to artificial intelligence.

""In selecting James, Google is making clear that its version of 'ethics' values proximity to power over the well-being of trans people, other LGBTQ people, and immigrants,"" Google workers said in a Medium post this week.

They pointed to Coles James' tweets that spoke out against the Equality Act, which would add sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes under federal laws; declared that Heritage would ""critique gender identity"" before the United Nations ""because powerful nations are pressing for the radical redefining of sex""; and blamed Congress for President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency to fund a border wall.

Other members of the board had reportedly quit since the controversy over James' appointment.

""It's become clear that in the current environment, ATEAC can't function as we wanted,"" a Google spokesperson said late Thursday. ""So we're ending the council and going back to the drawing board. We'll continue to be responsible in our work on the important issues that AI raises, and will find different ways of getting outside opinions on these topics.""

Google - which like other tech companies faces accusations of liberal bias - formed the external ethics council after unveiling AI principles last year. CEO Sundar Pichai announced the principles after employee protests over Project Maven, which used Google's AI to improve accuracy of drone strikes. Among those principles is a promise to avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias.

HIGHLIGHT:еКFountain Alley Building is the working title for the project that would rise on South First Street in downtown San Jose and add a mix of office, retail and restaurants spaces to the site, which is next to another historic building, the Bank of Italy office tower.

SAN JOSE - The site of the former Lido night club in downtown San Jose is headed for a major facelift that would preserve the property's key historic elements and add offices, retail, a restaurant and a new fountain, according to preliminary documents on file with city officials.

Fountain Alley Building is the working title for the project that would rise on South First Street in downtown San Jose and bring a mix of office, retail and dining spaces to the site, which is next to another historic building, the Bank of Italy office tower.

The six-story development is expected to total at least 50,000 square feet, according to planning documents and project builders.

""The new building will be predominantly retail and restaurant on the ground level and office on levels two through six,"" according to public documents submitted by the developers and Studio Current, which has designed the project.

The project has emerged as a joint effort by two San Jose-based real estate and investment companies: Urban Catalyst, headed by developer Erik Hayden, and Urban Community, led by developer Gary Dillabough.

""The corner of the building at South First and Fountain Alley will have a water fountain to identify it as the Fountain Alley Building,"" stated the documents on file with the city.

The 36 S. First St. structure is officially known as the Knox Goodrich Building and was constructed by Sarah Knox-Goodrich in 1889, according to a marker outside the building that described it as a ""charming commercial structure.""

She was ""a strong advocate of women's rights and organized San Jose's first Woman Suffrage Association in 1869,"" the marker states. Her first husband, William Knox, was co-founder of San Jose's first bank. Her second husband, Levi Goodrich, was the architect of old county courthouses in San Jose, Monterey and San Diego.

The developers intend to upgrade and preserve the historic Knox Goodrich building so it can become the primary lobby entrance for the new office building, according to the planning documents.

""Special care will be given to maintain the entire 1889 building and the historic facade while renovating the entry lobby,"" the developers said in the city files.

Dillabough has begun wide-ranging renovations and revivals of multiple historic or older buildings in downtown San Jose, notably the Bank of Italy office tower.

The renovation of the old Lido Club property is made possible, in part, because it's located in an opportunity zone. In numerous communities in the United States, opportunity zones have been enabled by President Donald Trump's tax-cut initiative.

Urban Catalyst, Hayden's firm, was formed to create an opportunity fund that would provide development expertise and cash for selected properties in Bay Area districts that have been designated as opportunity zones. Large sections of downtown San Jose, as well as parts of Oakland and San Francisco, are in opportunity zones.

Potentially the first project in the San Jose opportunity zone would be the redevelopment of the Lido Club site.

""This is a great location for a new development,"" Dillabough said in an interview earlier this year to discuss the Lido site's redevelopment. ""Our goal is to activate and revitalize that entire block.""

A growing number of developers and investors have become intrigued by downtown San Jose in the wake of plans by tech titans such as Google and Adobe to create big new expansions in the urban heart of the Bay Area's largest city.

Google has proposed a transit-oriented community of office buildings, homes, shops and restaurants near the Diridon train station where 25,000 could work, including 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giant's employees.

Adobe intends to dramatically expand its downtown San Jose headquarters campus of three office high rises by building a fourth office tower on an adjacent lot where 4,000 of the cloud service giant's employees would work.

""If you look at downtown San Jose, why wouldn't you develop here,"" Hayden said in a prior interview. ""Downtown San Jose is poised to take the next leap forward.""",125,Levi Sumagaysay,2-Apr-19,Google's Latest Dilemma: Employees Want Right-wing Figure Off New Ai Council,922,The East Bay Times (california),,"Google's Latest Dilemma: Employees Want Right-wing Figure Off New Ai Council

HIGHLIGHT:еКMore than 1,200 employees, 200 others object to inclusion of Heritage Foundation president on external council charged with helping responsible advancement of AI.

Google is facing yet another test as it faces accusations that it's too liberal: Its employees are demanding that it remove a conservative think tank's leader from the company's newly formed ethics advisory council.

More than 1,200 Google employees are calling on the tech giant to remove Kay Coles James, president of the Heritage Foundation, from the Advanced Technology External Advisory Council. The eight-member council was formed to ""consider some of Google's most complex challenges that arise under our AI Principles,"" said Kent Walker, senior vice president for global affairs, in an announcement last week.

""In selecting James, Google is making clear that its version of 'ethics' values proximity to power over the well-being of trans people, other LGBTQ people, and immigrants,"" Google workers said in a post this week. As of Tuesday, their petition had also been signed by more than 200 technologists, activists and academics outside the company.

They pointed to Coles James' tweets that spoke out against the Equality Act, which would add sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes under federal laws; declared that Heritage would ""critique gender identity"" before the United Nations ""because powerful nations are pressing for the radical redefining of sex""; and blamed Congress for President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency to fund a border wall.

Google has not returned requests for comment Tuesday, and neither has the Washington, DC-based Heritage Foundation, whose mission is to formulate and promote conservative public policies.

""Google is pandering to a group that already has significant power in Washington,"" said Liz Fong-Jones, a former Google employee who has signed the petition, in an interview. ""It sends a harmful message that Google wants to listen to people who have specific goals to erase trans people.""

Fong-Jones, who is transgender, quit her job as a site reliability engineer at Google in January. In a Medium post at the time, she said the company ""has misused its power to place profits above the well-being of people.""

The external ethics council was born from the AI principles Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced last year after employee protests over Project Maven, which used Google's AI to improve accuracy of drone strikes. Among those principles is a promise to avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias - a common concern amid the rise of artificial intelligence - which includes the following sentence: ""We will seek to avoid unjust impacts on people, particularly those related to sensitive characteristics such as race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, income, sexual orientation, ability, and political or religious belief.""

One advisory council member quit four days after its launch.

""While I'm devoted to research grappling with key ethical issues of fairness, rights & inclusion in AI, I don't believe this is the right forum for me to engage in this important work,"" Alessandro Acquisti, professor of information technology and public policy at the Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, tweeted March 30.

This is the latest backlash Google has faced from its employees. Other employee protests have included opposition to Project Maven (the company's artificial intelligence contract with the Pentagon), plans to revive its search engine in China, and mandatory arbitration agreements. In November, thousands of Googlers from around the world walked out after a report that Google had given large payouts to top executives accused of sexual misconduct, including Android creator Andy Rubin.

Most recently, Google's full-time employees have been aligning themselves with temporary workers whose contracts have been shortened. Hundreds of full-timers signed a letter last week protesting the treatment of TCV (temp, contract and vendor) workers, who reportedly make up half of Google's workforce.

The employee protests have led Google to vow it is making changes, including getting rid of mandatory arbitration requirements in all cases going forward, and letting its Project Maven contract expire. Tuesday, Google reportedly told employees it will require TCV workers to get full benefits and a minimum wage.

Meanwhile, Google and other tech giants are grappling with accusations - from within their ranks and from lawmakers and others - that they are too liberal and don't value conservative viewpoints.

Garrett Johnson, co-founder of the Lincoln Network, a nationwide community of right-wing tech workers, pointed out in an interview Tuesday that ""James is a black woman from the South with lots of policy experience.

""Is that expertise and perspective overshadowed by what people perceive to be comments that cross a line?"" Johnson asked.

Fong-Jones says she doesn't see this latest battle as political.

ABSTRACT

For the second timeеКrunning, Zillow crowned San Jose, California, with an auspicious title this year: It's theеКhottest housing marketеКin the country. When ZillowеКreleased statsеКranking the median income of buyers and renters in cities around the country, San Jose topped the list again. Look around, though, and few are celebrating.

In one apartment, Shavell Crawford lives with her fiancМ© and four roommates. She works days as an executive assistant, studies nights as a law student, and often thinks about leaving the state before her wedding. ""Do we want to live in California and have our first house be between $800,000 and $1.5 million?"" she asks. ""When we say our 'I Do's' are we going to come back to roommates?"" Behind another door is Nuemi Guzman, who wakes up at 4:30 a.m. every morning and gets home at 7:30 p.m., after a two-and-a-half-hour commute to work in Los Banos. Her parents spend more time with her kids than she does. She dreams of Arizona.

Meanwhile, in a $1,500-a-month studio,еКtwo cats liveеКalone while their owner resides elsewhere and stops in to feed them daily. ""Peak Silicon Valley,"" the Mercury NewsеКcalled the plush set-up. But the apartment is actually a steal: Average rent for a studioеКin the city is closer to $2,000.

This dynamic has made San Jose an emblem of California and the Bay Area's widening inequality.еКBut at a time when dozens of cities around the state are facing similarly dire housing crises, San Jose has also tried to position itself as the laboratory for working with the state's new governor to make the problem better. The stand both Governor Gavin Newsom and San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo are taking: Neither city nor state can solve this alone.

Shortly after starting his governorship in January, Newsom announced a dramatic housing ""Marshall Plan,"" saying he'd aim to build 3.5 million new homes across the state by the end of his term. To do it, the state will earmark $1.75 billion of new funding in California's 2019-2020 budget towards affordable housing projects, Newsom said. That investment may just scratch the surface of housing action needed, however-and the plan's success will rely heavily on regional collaboration and participation from city leaders.

To incentivize that broad local buy-in, the state will offer ""carrots and sticks,"" Newsom has said: If cities don't meet their housing production goals, for example, their transportation funding will be withheld. It's a contentious strategy that someеКadvocates worry could reinforce inequality within and between California regions, even as it hinders community NIMBYism. But it's one that Liccardo has endorsed.

""God's not making any more land,"" Liccardo told CityLab. ""So we need everybody to be all hands on deck.""

In his corner of the Bay Area, Liccardo has already been working towards an ambitious goal for San Jose, set before Newsom's intervention. By 2022, he wants to build 10,000 affordable units. And so, even as the city facesеКongoing political resistance, the city has become a petri dish of housing pilots.

There are classic tactics like monetary investments in affordable housing, and job creation. There are experimental ideas like developingеКthe world's largest planned co-living building; a community built out of refurbished shipping containers for the homeless; andеКa temporary tiny homes pilot. There are pro-development ideas, like cutting taxes to speed up and cheapen construction, and reducing fees to build low-income housing.

And there's an ambitious political strategy undergirding it: aеК34-point work planеКthe San Jose council has been following since last year, the first of its kind used to navigate its housing crisis. Among the priorities are establishing minimum height and density requirements, slashing parking requirements, and exploring the idea of a land trust.

Despite all this, San Jose's efforts are also emblematic of another Bay Area challenge. However aggressive, the city's actions have not yet moved the needle far enough for people like Crawford, Guzman, and theеК4,350 homeless residents counted in 2017, nearly three quarters of whom go unsheltered each night.

In fact, theеКcity council's March reviewеКof building permits approved in the past year revealed that San Jose is actually behind on its state-mandated housing development goal, which was to produce more than 35,000 units between 2014 and 2022. It issued only about 3,000 permits last year, according to the San Jose Spotlight; 1,000 fewer than needed to keep on track.

And most stilted is progress on getting the 10,000 affordable units down the pipeline. San Jose permitted only 61 percent of the affordable housing units it aimed to build last year.

""We're looking under every rock for ideas""

The city has time to right the course before 2022. ""We're looking under every rock for ideas,"" Liccardo said.

One of them is simple: Building more housing. By halving construction taxes on high-rises and letting developers wait to pay taxes and fees until the certificate of occupancy is signed, the costs of building could drop by $1.5 million, Liccardo wrote in a March memo.

His proposal could streamline the development process and address the labor problem that, at least in part, is also driving the state-wide housing shortage. To produce new homes at the rate Newsom is proposing, one pro-union nonprofit estimated that the stateеКwould need 200,000 more construction workers-about the number it lost between 2006 and 2017.

""The cost of construction is high because the cost of labor is high, but the cost of labor is high partially because folks can't afford to live here that work in construction,"" said Alex Shoor, the co-founder of the organization Catalyze SV. ""So we've artificially constrained the market by making it so difficult to live here."" It's created a snowball effect.

Increasing overall supply can drive down home prices, and slow that snowball. But that's not always the same as building units that are truly affordable, which the city is also pushing. This February, San Jose's Housing Department proposed aеК$100 million investmentеКin more than 1,000 affordable units across 11 developments. The full city council must approve each development individually, but if all is green-lit, a little more than a quarter of the housing will be built for formerly homeless people, according to theеКEast Bay Times, and more than halfеКfor low-income San Joseans.

Later this year, the city will also break ground on a dorm-style co-living building of about 800 units. When it opens in 2021, it will be the largest co-living building of its kind in the world,еКaccording to its developer, Starcity, which will rent out the rooms for between $800 and $2,500. The Starcity building is marketed towards people making between $40,000 and $120,000 a year-not only for low-income renters, in other words-who are willing to share a kitchen and a living room.

On one city-owned property in the Willow Glen neighborhood, a 61-unit village designed specifically for homeless people will be built out of refurbished shipping containers. Over two years, the site is expected to house 300 to 400 people, and will include a small garden and a library. But at $600,000 per unit-or $2,500 per square foot-the project's cost has raised eyebrows. ""This seems exorbitant for recycled metal boxes, quite frankly,"" Councilman Johnny Khamis said at a council meeting,еКaccording to theеКMercury News.

TwoеКtiny home villagesеКoperated by the nonprofit HomeFirst will also open this summer, in a pilot that will run at least through January 2022. The almost 80 small housing units total are designed as temporary, transitional housing. They'll include shared bathrooms and kitchen space, computer access, and connections to social services.

Overcoming Community Resistance

Both projects' years-long journey to approval illuminates another obstacle the city faces as it reaches towards development goals: community pushback. The shipping container plan emerged afterеКneighbors fought overеКa proposal to build almost 150 temporary modular homes on the same site, and the village, too, was scaled down from an earlier proposal that would have included dozens of sites after neighborhood fears over ""crime, traffic, and property values."" Another plan toеКbuild affordable housing for public school teachersеКin the San Jose Unified School District came under fire last October, when hundreds of parents and locals in one particularly wealthy neighborhood signed a petition opposing the proposal because of the neighborhood change it might bring.

The negative attitude towards new development, particularly for low-income or homeless renters, is hardly unique to San Jose; indeed, it's what Newsom's ""sticks"" are designed to poke. Catalyze SV's Shoor, who considers the organization to be a ""cousin"" to the Yes In My Backyard (YIMBY) movement, blames a lack of clear engagement between developers and residents throughout the design process, and before construction begins.

And, to achieve real momentum on housing, says Shoor, the approach can't solely be top-down-it has to be, as Liccardo says, all hands on deck. ""You need state government to help create the moral mandate and the state policy framework for approving housing, and you need local governments like the city of San Jose to have elected officials who are courageous enough to approve housing projects,"" said Shoor. But you also ""need private companies both in Silicon Valley here in the tech sector and up and down our state"" investing in transportation, non-profits, homeless services, and affordable housing.

And they are. AfterеКMicrosoft pledged $500 millionеКin loans and grants towards affordable housing construction in Seattle, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and other local tech leaders joined to form the Partnership for the Bay's Future, whichеКpledged another $500 million to affordable efforts in the Bay AreaеКand vowed to put pressure on local governments to increase things like tenant protections. ""Housing and displacement is so complicated, so taking a multi-pronged approach can be beneficial to communities that are dealing with not only a supply issue, but an issue of abuses that tenants face,"" said Jeffrey Buchanan, the director of public policy for the Silicon Valley organizing group, Working Partnerships USA.

In issuing most of the funding via loans, not outright donations, though, tech companies are opening up glorifiedеКhousing trust-funds, argues Henry Grabar in Slate; and housing analysts and advocates add that the housing funds won't be enough to make the dent needed in the regions. The Partnership for the Bay's Future is expected to ""add or preserve only around 8,000 homes in the next five to 10 years,""еКaccording toеКBloomberg.

A Bedroom Community No Longer?

Meanwhile, another tech giant's interest has some local advocates worried that the pricey zip code will only get more unaffordable. In December 2018, San Jose sold Google several plots of landеКnear Diridon Station, a downtown transit hub which is also slated for expansion. Over the next decade, Google plans to hire between 15,000 and 20,000 employees to fill its buildings. That means a lot more employees-from a range of income levels-will be looking to buy and rent a lot more housing.

Liccardo argues that what San Jose needs more than anything is jobs: The city has long served as more of a bedroom community than its neighboring Silicon Valley tech hubs of Mountain View and Cupertino. It's ""the only major city in the country that has a smaller daytime population than nighttime population,"" Liccardo points out frequently, with the worst jobs-to-housing balance in the country.

The city's current focus on housing development will partly soften the blow, says Leslye Corsiglia, the executive director of Silicon Valley @ Home, an affordable housing advocacy organization. ""Google's really just jump-starting the growth that San Jose had already planned for, and making it possible.""

In addition, San Jose committed $10 million in January towards supporting the state's $500 million efforts to build workforce housing for local residents making 60 to 80 percent of the area median income. That investment targets the ""missing middle,"" which Newsom identified as a population underserved by existing housing in the state. It's ""the housing where jobs go to sleep,"" he said at the round-table. ""It's the issue that drove me to great frustration as a mayor,"" Liccardo agreed.

And the city says it's in the process of negotiating community benefits with Google, including a commitment that a quarter of the housing built near Diridon Station be affordable. Working Partnership's Buchanan notes, however, that Google has not yet committed to anything concrete, and that it was conspicuously absent from the list of tech companies that signed on to Chan Zuckerberg's partnership. ""Google is going to cost renters in the Bay by moving into San Jose,"" Buchanan said. ""Renters are going to continue to be in trouble.""

In all, the amount the city and state are potentially investing in San Jose to fight back against this continuing cost escalation is on track to skyrocket by far more than $100 million this year. But how much of it will be approved by voters and lawmakers remains to be seen.

An initiative to create a $450 million affordable housing bond for the city of San Jose was the only bond to fail on last November's ballot, getting just a few percentage points shy of the two-thirds support needed to pass. With an eye towards 2020, the city isеКdeveloping a new housing-funding ballot initiative. And instead of aiming lower, Corsiglia says they're aiming higher.

For current residents Guzman, however, it may be too little, too late. ""I bought a house. How can I be complaining? But then, I don't see my children grow up,"" she said in January, wiping away tears. ""Now, Arizona? I guess, here we come.""",127,Lauren Hepler,27-Mar-19,Lifetime Achievement: Tmg Partners' Ceo Doesn't Shy From Complex Deals And,925,San Francisco Business Times (california),,"Lifetime Achievement: Tmg Partners' Ceo Doesn't Shy From Complex Deals And

Michael Covarrubias likes to say that he got into real estate ""by accident,"" at the urging of a colleague back when he was a banker during Silicon Valley's computing boom of the 1980s. At TMG partners, the San Francisco real estate firm he's helmed for the last 24 years, Covarrubias says he's ""been lucky a lot"" in amassing a portfolio spanning tens of millions of square feet across the Bay Area.

Despite a schedule stretched thin between meetings about a new Oakland tower or overhauling the old California Pacific Medical Center into housing and his several board chairships, Covarrubias still prefers to meet in person rather than talk over the phone. Google hangouts aren't in his repertoire, and he prefers self-critiques to self-congratulations.

""We've been able to go into markets at the right time, execute a plan, get out with our capital partners feeling good, and then do it again,"" Covarrubias said. ""You could get caught up in 'Wow, that was great.' We're always looking to get better.""

Growing up in East Oakland, Covarrubias saw firsthand what happens when neighborhoods are neglected and buildings slip into disrepair. A USF math major-turned-business grad who started out doing commercial financing for Union Bank, he still uses a play on finance jargon, IRR - usually meaning ""Internal Rate of Return""- as an acronym for TMG's mission of ""Integrity Relationships Results.""

At times, the learning curve was sharp, like with the unwieldy master redevelopment of a former Marin City flea market site into a mix of apartments, for-sale housing, new freeway infrastructure, community assets and more during the '80s and '90s.

""My phrase at the end of that was, 'I'm pretty sure I'm going to get into heaven now,'"" Covarrubias said. ""It had to be done with the community.""

Today, Covarrubias divides TMG's pursuits into ""four food groups"" - ground-up development or rehabs of either residential or office space. In addition to projects underway in Oakland and San Jose, he's staying busy in San Francisco with a plan to convert the former CPMC Hospital building into an ""Upper-East-Side-meets-Presidio-Heights"" residential development. The variety in project scope and design is intentional.

""We're really proud of the fact that we come in with a blank sheet of paper,"" he said.

Ned Spieker, a longtime TMG board member, met Covarrubias when he was a young banker. Since then, Spieker has seen Covarrubias become ""one of the most successful real estate investors of this era""- so much so that he's ""built bigger and better versions"" of several of Spieker's former commercial projects in Silicon Valley. Take a one-story Clyde Avenue office complex in Mountain View, just off the 101 freeway, which Spieker leased to General Electric some 40 years earlier.

""I drove by one day on the freeway, and they were leveled,"" Spieker said of the property, which TMG demolished, rebuilt and leased to Samsung in 2015. ""Now there's a 7-story building there.""

Development side effects

For much of Covarrubias' career, he's also been focused on a fundamental quandary: how to address the side effects of skyrocketing land values and a series of development booms that have been very good to companies like his.

""This region has gotten a little out of control,"" said Covarrubias, a board chair for regional development groups including the Bay Area Council and the Urban Land Institute. ""Bridges are falling down. When it's not sustainable is probably getting close. People are leaving.""

Last year, at TMG's 33-and-a-third party celebrating a third-of-a-century in business, Covarrubias chose a theme that he thinks will guide both the firm's and the Bay Area's futures: the rise of a ""megaregion"" no longer confined to traditional population hubs like San Francisco. Since 2015, TMG has expanded in Oakland with office overhauls and a proposed downtown tower, plus a 1.1 million-square-foot joint venture near San Jose's Diridon Station and a proposed South Bay campus for Google. TMG just hired Ben Kochalski to head up a new Silicon Valley office.

Though a developer championing more supply in the market might seem contradictory at times, Bay Area CEO Jim Wunderman says the role suits Covarrubias.

""He lives in a world of common sense,"" Wunderman said, ""and we're in a society that doesn't rely on that too much.""

While TMG's hallmark deals in San Francisco have been rehabs of existing buildings, like the recession-era revamp of 680 Folsom, Covarrubias also sees longer-term opportunity in Fremont and exurbs like Stockton and Tracy.

Decades of doing the legwork on towers, public markets, housing complexes and office buildings has really come full circle in the last few years for Covarrubias, during his time co-chairing the Metropolitan Transportation Commission's ""Committee to House the Bay Area,"" or CASA.

After technical meetings, community forums and contentious public hearings, Covarrubias said the group had to appeal to ""enlightened self-interest"" to get developers, unions, tech companies, activists and other stakeholders aligned on 10 housing policy pillars now being deliberated in Sacramento.

Even after the Herculean efforts required on housing, Covarrubias says he has no plans to slow down. For now, there's too much work to do on both TMG's next wave of megaprojects and the Bay Area's most vexing challenges.

""We're a long way from any of this being done,"" he said.

Activist. Feminist. Spiritual entrepreneur. Beauty pageant champ.

One of these would seem to be not like the other. But as a new member of the religious community in Boulder, the Rev. Nicole Lamarche makes it all seem a seamless fit.

Lamarche, 40, took the helm of south Boulder's Community United Church of Christ on Jan. 8, and has quickly made herself at home, earning the respect of her congregation and her peers.

Coming from the Urban Sanctuary, a startup church originally known as the Silicon Valley Progressive Faith Community in downtown San Jose, Calif., Lamarche, her husband and 7-year-old daughter found their way to CUCC by way of a ""nationwide search."" She said she and her family considered factors including Boulder's strong public schools, the ""huge draw"" of the city and its unique ""vibe.""

She also was attracted by a congregation she describes as ""a beautiful, funky mix of how the tradition is expressed.""

Lamarche's path, winding back in time from Boulder, runs not only through San Jose, but to her first church in the quaint village of Cotuit on Cape Cod, Mass., to seminary at the Pacific School of Religion and the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley - she was a member of the Interfaith Tent at Occupy Oakland - and, Miss California 2003, which she followed with a fourth runner-up finish for Miss America 2004.

At her new church, ""They keep telling me how young I am. I just came from the Silicon Valley, where you're dead after 30. This is so refreshing,"" said Lamarche, who marries a rooted self confidence with self-deprecating asides and hearty laughs. Advertisement

Among her congregation of about 400 people, her success as a beauty queen (her talent offering at Miss America was singing Billy Vera and the Beaters' ""At This Moment"") is no secret.

""Some of them were kind of worried about that. Like a lot of ministry, you try to get under the question. What are they really asking? The way it was expressed was discomfort with celebrity,"" she said in a recent interview at her sunny, welcoming church office on Table Mesa Drive. ""And to me, it's like, are you kidding? I'm a washed-up beauty queen. That was 15 years ago."" The Rev. Nicole Lamarche poses for a portrait in the sanctuary at Community United Church of Christ in Boulder on Friday. (Matthew Jonas / Staff Photographer)

John Woods was on the church search committee that brought Lamarche to her new parish.

""I look at that (pageant participation) as someone who was very creative with what they had, to be able to get a scholarship to carry her debt-free through college and seminary,"" Woods said.

""She got a lot of support from the school in Berkeley, that she was going through at the time. They thought it was a very cool thing that she was doing. She was encouraged at a number of levels to make that happen.""

Mark Dunn Lewis is another church member who was on the search committee. Color him impressed.

""She's really stands out in her organization, her energy and her depth of education and I'd say philosophy,"" Dunn Lewis said. ""She's a very engaging person, very well informed. Her mind is going a million miles a minute, all day long.""

'Nicole actually made it work'

Lamarche, who estimates she won close to $50,000 in pageant scholarship money - she also claimed first-runner-up to Miss Arizona dating back to her undergraduate years - got far more out of Berkeley. That's where she was grounded in social and political activism. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks happened during her first week at seminary.

""As you would hope for a minister showing up at that time, it really shaped all of us who were there at that time,"" she said. ""And so it was kind of my first time as an activist, you know, because it was the buildup to the Iraq war.

""Looking back, at the time, it felt scary to say 'No this is wrong, we shouldn't do this, it's going to be a waste of treasure and lives.' And I remember being terrified my family was going to see me on TV,"" said Lamarche, a native of Spokane, Wash.

""The very first step at that time was to go to the streets. And so a bunch of us did. Some got arrested. I didn't. I was still chicken.""

But she was imbued with an activist spirit and a passion for social justice that has stayed with her. Chris Braudaway-Bauman, who has known Lamarche since Lamarche started out at the Wellesley Congregational Church in Wellesley, Mass., as a pastoral resident.

""That church was selected as one of 20 congregations in the country to host a program for new pastors, the brightest and the best coming out of seminary, to get a strong start in ministry,"" said Braudaway-Bauman, who is now senior minister of First Congregational Church, United Church of Christ, Boulder, a church in the same family as CUCC. ""I was the coordinator, and Nicole was one of the first pastoral residents there.""

After Lamarche's time in Massachusetts, Braudaway-Bowman said, ""This brave woman went to the Silicon Valley to launch a new congregation, the Silicon Valley Progressive Faith Community. Lots of people have ambitions, callings to do such a thing, but Nicole actually made it work.

""And in the process, she learned so much about what the future church needs to look like, and how we can reach out into the wider community and call people to faith and create a community that really speaks to progressive Christians, people who are uneasy about faith, people who are not sure they have faith, and folks who are looking for a new way to be together.""

Lamarche relished her role as founding member of that new congregation in California, where she spent 2012 to 2017. But she admits that after five years of the labors the assignment entailed, ""I was ready to not scrap anymore.""

And then there was Google.

""We bought our house in 2012. And in 2016, Google said they were going to build a 30,000-person campus (in San Jose), in an area that already has an affordable housing crisis."" she recalled. ""So, that has had all kinds of really terrible consequences, in my perspective, which is part of the reason we wanted to leave.

""But as a homeowner, you can imagine, that's spectacularly amazing news. So we didn't even have to put our house on the market. ... That's the only reason we could buy a house in Boulder. Someone shows up, offers more than you're asking, bam!""

'New ideas and inspiration'

Janet Hoaglund, lay moderator at CUCC and a member of the south Boulder congregation since 1982, has been delighted at the way Lamarche has adapted to her new role.

""She's been wonderful. She's bringing new ideas and inspiration,"" Hoaglund said, mentioning Lamarche's initiative to hold weekly informal ""hang out with the rev"" coffee klatches at Boulder's CaffМ¬ Sole, her visits to elderly parishioners at Frasier Meadows, even expanding the church's musical offerings

""She's going to the neighborhood, as opposed to the neighborhood coming to her,"" Hoaglund said.

As for Lamarche's pageant background, Hoaglund acknowledged curiosity and interest on the part of some in the congregation.

""For me, I would say it was exciting to hear that while she was involved in it, she worked to change the bathing suit portion, she worked to make it more about the person, and the way they think and act, and less about the way they looked. That was the impression I got, which fits with who she is and her values,"" Hoaglund said.

Actually, that's not exactly true. Rather than pushing back on the bathing suit issue, Lamarche actually won the bathing suit portion of the competition at the 2004 Miss America pageant.

""I was honest about my ambivalence about the swimwear part of the competition. But back then, eliminating it was not on the table,"" said Lamarche. She did, however, eschew high heels in the bathing suit competition for a Miss Tucson pageant in the early days, competing barefoot - but only because she had not yet learned how to walk in heels.

The swimsuits were actually not eliminated at Miss America until last year, an announcement made in June 2018 by Miss America Chairman Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News host and 1989 Miss America, in an effort to update the event for the #MeToo era

""And yes, I won that part of the competition, which is really quite funny to me. I have always been a runner, so I guess those marathons in my 20s paid off,"" Lamarche said.

She laughs a bit about the perception among some in the Miss America universe that she might be a lesbian, as she wore short hair, had liberal Berkeley in her background, and was carving out a career in the ministry. But she did run counter to the flow in some other respects.

""I was accidentally radical in the organization - more than I anticipated,"" she recalled. ""I asked years ago, how could Miss America be run by a man? It just seemed ridiculous to me. How could they talk about empowering women? It was ridiculous.""

She also used her Miss California title as a pulpit, once she had entered the ministry on Cape Cod, to voice her counterpoint to Carrie Prejean, the 2009 winner of Miss California USA, who had gained notoriety by speaking out against same-sex marriage. Opposing her pageant sister's conservative stance landed Lamarche on ""Larry King Live.""

'Platform for transformation'

One aspect of her time in the pageants Lamarche still values, she said, is that ""It was another setting, like a religious community, where you learn to love people you might not necessarily like ... I think society has become very niche, where we hang out with like-minded people. And so I think that was a really great setting. It was Repubs and Dems together, and in that sense, I really appreciate that.""

She added, ""I think a lot of those southern girls, if they had never interacted with me or heard my ideas, would they have even known there is such a thing as a liberal Christian?""

Lamarche, whose ministerial accolades include having been named America's Next Top Faith Voice in 2011 and being awarded a fellowship in the Beatitude Society, spoke to her bottom-line motivation for being in Boulder, ""this secular town, this post religious-time,"" as she put it, in her new role.

""I think it's too hard to live what we say we believe, without other people,"" she said. ""And in a town of people who claim to want to save and change the world, I think it's an ancient and important platform for transformation, both for individuals and the common good, being part of a community.

""People say, 'Oh it's easy to find God in the woods,' or whatever. But I think the harder thing, if it's people, if it's really about growing and love, just showing up on a regular basis for just, like, a random mix of people, I think that is literally a way to become more compassionate. I really do.

""And I think that's powerful.""

Certainly the downtown of today is nothing in comparison to the downtown of 1947, but in 1964 my father was project architect on the Superior Court building at Market and Second streets. That building was designed for seven stories, but due to height restrictions imposed by the FAA one story had to be removed from the design before being approved.

HIGHLIGHT:еКGZI North First, an affiliate of a development company based in China, bought a building at 2665 N. First St. between West Trimble Road and West Plumeria Drive on March 19, paying $41 million,

SAN JOSE - An investment group based in China has bought a large office building in north San Jose, an area that has become a commercial property hotbed for developers, tech companies and investors.

GZI North First, an affiliate of a developer based in China with offices in Seattle, purchased the building at 2665 N. First St. between West Trimble Road and West Plumeria Drive on March 19.

""North San Jose is getting a lot more attention from investors and companies,"" said Lena Tutko, research manager Silicon Valley for Colliers International, a commercial real estate firm. ""A lot of companies are migrating there from Palo Alto, Sunnyvale and Mountain View.""

The buyer paid $41 million, according to Santa Clara County public records.

Multiple business records show a principal executive of the buying group is Yuan Lin, who is an executive with China-based development companies Guangdong Zhonghuan Investment Group and GZI China. On Thursday a colleague reached by phone in the Seattle offices of GZ said Lin couldn't be reached because he was traveling to China.

""$2 Million in renovations for entries, landscaping, lobby"" have been undertaken in the building in recent years, according to a post on a web site established by CBRE, a commercial real estate firm.

CBRE is seeking tenants for the building, which is nearly full.

NKF Capital Markets commercial real estate agents Steven Golubchik, Edmund Najera, Tyler Meyerdirk, and Darren Hollak represented the building's sellers, a partnership of New York Life Investors and Seagate Properties.

""2665 North First Street received substantial interest driven largely by the diminishing supply of multi-tenant office product in the North First corridor of San Jose,"" Najera said.

GZI North First also obtained a $26 million loan from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China to finance the property purchase, county documents revealed.

""There is a lot of interest in north San Jose that is coming from Asian capital sources,"" Tutko said.

On March 11, an affiliate of Japan-based Mori Trust paid an eye-popping $429 million in cash for a three-building office campus in north San Jose on Holger Way that is fully leased to tech company Micron Technology.

In June 2018, affiliates of South Korea-based Hana Asset Management and Southern California-based Ocean West Capital Partners paid 132.5 million for an office complex on North First Street that's leased to eBay. That same month, a group controlled by Hong Kong-based Gaw Capital Management paid $93.5 million for an office campus leased to Toshiba at the corner of West Trimble Road and Orchard Parkway.

Tech companies also have begun to push into north San Jose lately.

Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung have all bought large properties in north San Jose, including some deals on North First Street.

Cupertino-based Apple has assembled several properties in north San Jose into a site that would be large enough to accommodate a huge 85-acre campus for the iPhone maker.

In October 2018, Google bought two north San Jose office buildings at 4300 N. First St. and 4400 N. First St., paying $154.5 million for the modern offices. In January 2018, Google paid $117.3 million for three new industrial buildings a few hundred yards away.

This collection of five big buildings could be the start of what might emerge as a new Google campus in north San Jose where thousands of the search giant's employees could work.

Office vacancies in north San Jose are at around 16.1 percent, compared with vacancy rates that are in the very low single digits in Mountain View, Sunnyvale and Palo Alto - even as low as 1 percent - according to Tutko's research.

As a result, technology companies might encounter more elbow room in north San Jose, a dynamic that makes the area more attractive for investors.

""North San Jose is a good landing spot for tech companies that need to expand,"" Tutko said.",131,Rex Crum,20-Mar-19,Google Gets Hit With $1.7b Fine From European Union,388,The East Bay Times (california),,"Google Gets Hit With $1.7b Fine From European Union

The European Union on Wednesday slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine for the company's efforts to block its competitors in the online advertising market.

The decision covers a decade-long period from 2006 to 2016 in which the EU said Google used its market position to clamp down on the ability of third-party rivals to display search ads. Among the methods the EU said Google used included exclusivity contracts that prevented website owners from including search results from rivals of Google.

The EU also said that beginning in 2009, Google began implementing ""premium placement"" clauses, which required publishers to request a minimum number of Google ads and to leave the most-profitable spaces on their search result pages for Google ads.

Margrethe Vestager, the EU's commissioner in charge of competition policy, said in a statement that Google's restrictions were ""illegal under EU antitrust rules,"" and ""denied other companies the possibility to compete on the merits and to innovate - and consumers the benefits of competition.""

Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president for global policy, said in a statement that the company was working to ensure its products meet all the EU's business standards.

It was the third fine the EU has levied against Google in the past two years. In 2017, the EU handed down a $2.7 billion penalty on Google for using preferential methods to promote its own shopping service over rival options, and in July of last year, European regulators slapped Google with a $5 billion fine for the abusing its market position to give preference to its Android operating system.",132,,19-Mar-19,Taking Video Games Out Of A Box Is Not The Future: Ceo Of Nvidia,391,Ce Noticias Financieras English,,"Taking Video Games Out Of A Box Is Not The Future: Ceo Of Nvidia

SAN JOSМд, CALIFORNIA (Expansion) .- This morning Google unveiled Stadia, a platform that will connect content with gamers from any platform, whether PC, smartphones, consoles or televisions, however for Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, this does not it is something new and less is the future.

""Supporting games in the cloud is not something new, we believe in the hybrid cloud in fact, what is really new is the support of applications of the future as is the case of raytracing, which can really revolutionize this market,"" said Huang, in a question and answer session within your GTC Nvidia conference. The tracing of rays, or raytracing, is a tool that directly impacts the rate of frames that are transmitted in video games and play a fundamental role in the user experience that gamers have, that is why to achieve a better support of this Tool is something that players can enjoy, it means they can have more immersive games, because it changes the lighting method when drawing a new graphic. This means that you can have more realistic scenarios in which the scenes may have more precise lighting and shade management. Taking advantage of the information bet that the world of technology has had with the launch of Stadia, the executive highlighted the partnership between Unreal Engine and Unity, since these two game engines will integrate this technology so that interested developers can exploit it to the fullest. ""The ray tracing is the future and responds to the demand for better graphics and the development of other experiences within the gamer world,"" Huang told journalists around the world. As the executive has used to show off his RTX cards, he does it in the same way with the support capacity he has in another industry, the gaming industry, in which Nvidia has managed to position itself as a benchmark for the creation of GeForce , graphic processing graphics cards highly used in gaming platforms and where they have consolidated their leadership in the segment for being the only company of its kind to make available to developers their tools to develop new products.

HIGHLIGHT:еКOvertime pay for call takers and dispatchers could have covered an additional 15 full-time employees.

Despite some improvement in the past couple of years, San Jose's fire and police departments still aren't answering emergency calls fast enough. And when they do pick up the phone quickly,еКit comes at a cost: lots of overtime.

That's according to a recent audit from city auditor Sharon Erickson, who laid out a series of recommendations for improving emergency call answering times in a city grappling with both an increasing volume of reports and job vacancies that have proven tough to fill.

In a joint response, Police Chief Eddie Garcia and Fire Chief Robert Sapien said they either agreed or partially agreed with Erickson's 19 recommendations and look ""forward to improving both the current performance and future programs.""

When someone dials 911 in California, the state says that 95 percent of calls should be answered within 15 seconds. In 2017, state officials notified San Jose that it was not meeting the target and must improve or risk losing funding for public safety services. Call answering times have improved, rising from below 80 percent several years ago to just over 90 percent in late 2018.

But, police call takers, who are the primary point of contact for callers, and dispatchers, who send police out to handle emergencies and routine jobs, have put in lots of extra hours to get there. OnеКaverage, they worked enough overtime hours in 2017-18 that the department could have hired an additional 15 full-time employees. The fire department also relied heavily on overtime.

""Staff we talked to were concerned about exhaustion, lack of time with their family and the resulting low morale,"" according to the report.

Rather than rely on so much overtime, Erickson suggested more aggressive recruiting and changing everything from how some calls are answered to who answers them.

Now, around 40 percent of the 1,400 calls San Jose Police Communications fields each day don't qualify as an emergency. San Jose still allows people who reach emergency call takers to file non-emergency crime reports over the phone.еКLos Angeles stopped that practice years ago, while San Francisco directs people to the non-emergency number 311 to make a report. San Jose, the auditor said, could also redirect such calls.

Even when residents try to navigate San Jose's own 311 phone tree intended for non-emergencies, about half the time they ultimately ask to talk to a call taker who could otherwise be freed up for emergency calls, often out of frustration caused by errors and technical glitches in the system. For instance, if someone is trying to reach the California Highway Patrol and asks to be transferred, the audit noted, the system routes them to an office that doesn't actually serve San Jose.

And if someone gets arrested and wants a copy of their police report, the phone tree will transfer them to the district attorney's office. But the district attorney doesn't want those calls; people should be told to contact their defense lawyer or the appropriate law enforcement agency instead, the audit said. And, only a couple of cellular companies - AT&T and Sprint - even offer 311 services in San Jose right now.

Garcia and Sapien acknowledged fixing such glitches is necessary and said staff would begin to look at the issue immediately, but warned that ""full implementation may take some time."" And they warned that while convincing other providers to offer customers the ability to dial 311 might have benefits, it could also increase the workload.

The pair also raised concerns about Erickson's recommendation that the administration make sure non-emergency services are available in languages besides English, calling it a long-term priority. Moving forward withеКthe recommendation now, they say, ""will adversely impact call answering times for both emergency and non-emergency calls, as non-emergency calls requiring translation will tie up existing call-taking resources.""

""Both the Police and Fire departments value our Communications teams and are committed to addressing these issues with aggressive recruiting, retention strategies, and innovative problem-solving, in addition to the prior steps the city has already taken to address these issues,"" Garcia and Sapien wrote.

The pair are expected to discuss the audit at the City Council meeting on Tuesday.",134,Janice Bitters,19-Mar-19,Jay Paul Co. Explains Why It's Bullish On San Jose As It Drops Hints About,921,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Jay Paul Co. Explains Why It's Bullish On San Jose As It Drops Hints About

Jay Paul Co. surprised many real estate insiders when it burst into the San Jose market last summer, decisively spending $283.5 million on CityView, a block-sized, mixed-use campus in the heart of downtown.

The San Francisco-based developer is led by and named for Jay Paul, its notoriously private, but also well-proven founder. The company has a reputation for making high-quality buildings that draw some of the largest tech giants in the world as tenants, including Google, Facebook, Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp.

""When [Jay] wants to do something, he proceeds quickly, and he has the economic wherewithal to compete with a REIT or any of the largest developers really in the world,"" Phil Mahoney, executive vice chairman for Newmark Knight Frank, told a luncheon crowd at a Commercial Real Estate Women (CREW) Silicon Valley event in San Jose last week.

Mahoney, who has worked on leasing buildings with Jay Paul for more than two decades, spoke alongside Janette D'Elia, Jay Paul Co.'s chief operating officer, during the panel event at the San Jose Capital Club in downtown.

The pair shed light - though careful not to reveal any ""secrets"" - on what prompted the Jay Paul Co. to invest in the San Jose market now for the first time, and how the company is thinking about its options for CityView, which has become one of the most anticipated redevelopment projects in the city.

Jay Paul leaders were inspired to move down the Peninsula, where they had previously been focusing their energy in San Francisco and Sunnyvale, to San Jose because of the city's urban downtown, said D'Elia, who is known as Jay Paul's right-hand woman and development guru.

""There's not a lot of opportunity in other parts of the Valley right now, and Jay wanting to continue to have a very robust pipeline also caused us to push out our sights a little bit farther,"" she said. ""San Jose came on the radar and once we started taking more time to look at it, we really decided that this would be our next big move.""

So far, the prolific developer has confirmed it plans to demolish and redevelop the nearly 600,000-square-foot CityView property. Rumors erupted shortly after the purchase that Jay Paul already had a tenant, the most prominent of the whispers being that Menlo Park-based Facebook was looking closely at the site.

But last week, Mahoney and D'Elia shrugged off talk of tenants in tow.

""The rumors that it's already leased.... if that's true, let us know,"" Mahoney laughed. ""It'd be nice if it was true, but it's not. Certainly, we've talked to different groups about different parts of it ... but it's still a pretty premature to talk about who any of the end users are going to be.""

D'Elia did note, however, that the company won't likely move ahead on building the project ""on spec,"" meaning without any tenants lock in.

Even so, Jay Paul is a long way from starting construction in any scenario. Many companies with leases on the site have packed up and moved, but the complex is far from empty. Meanwhile, San Jose city planners haven't yet seen a development proposal for the project.

A portion of the block-long downtown property currently has a proposal on file with the city of San Jose for a new 24-story residential tower, one of the last moves that the former property owner Equus Capital Partners made to improve the property value before selling. But that project proposal won't do Jay Paul much good.

""We are not going to be incorporating any high-density residential in CityView,"" D'Elia said during the event. ""We really feel strongly that it's best to serve as an office complex.""

Developers imagining dense new developments in San Jose have come at the right time. Even as city officials launch a study to impose new commercial development fees, San Jose's City Council last week also approved new development guidelines that will allow buildings to rise taller than in the past in and near the downtown core.

In the downtown core, where Jay Paul is looking to redevelop CityView, buildings will be able to rise about 35 feet taller than before. In the Diridon Station area, where Google is envisioning a new 6 million- to 8 million-square-foot mixed-use campus, buildings will be allowed to rise 150 feet taller than before.

In all, San Jose's downtown will see as much as 8.6 million square feet more development potential as a result of the new building height restrictions.

That approval, while not assumed by Jay Paul when they purchased property in downtown, is a plus, D'Elia said.

""It definitely wasn't in the underwriting, but It's a definite plus, and we're going to be taking advantage of it,"" she said. ""We really feel excited that San Jose is recognizing the need for more density downtown and adding the additional height is a way to accomplish that.""

Indeed, San Jose has momentum today that industry insiders and downtown enthusiasts say they think will stick, and veteran Silicon Valley broker Mahoney told industry insiders last week he thinks the city is poised for more growth.

When it comes to San Jose, ""its time is now and its time is the future,"" Mahoney said. ""I see almost no place that will be as vibrant as this marketplace over the next five, 10, 15 years.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe extra noise is thanks to Union Pacific, which recentlyеКmade some operating changes. Those changes, the company says, are meant to reduce the number of idling locomotives and the amount of time they stand still. But the shift also means more trains at odd hours.

When Susan Johnson and her husband bought their home last year a few blocks from the train tracks that cut through downtown and up Japantown, the neighborhood was relatively quiet after dark.

But in recent weeks, the couple has been getting an unpleasant wake-up call in the middle of the night: trains blaring their horns at 3 a.m.

We didnt sign up for this, a frustrated and sleep-deprived Johnson, 35, said after repeatedly being rousted from sleep by the horns. How are you supposed to sleep through that?

The extra noise is thanks to Union Pacific, which recentlyеКmade some operating changes. Those changes, the company says, are meant to reduce the number of idling locomotives and the amount of time they stand still. But the shift also means more trains at odd hours.

Train traffic has the potential to increase or decrease throughout our network, at any given time, said spokesman Tim McMahan in an email. We are at a point where communities in this area will see an increase in train traffic.

And, he added, At this time, we do not anticipate a decrease.

Now, two trains traverse the tracks twice - once each way - to make deliveries after 8 p.m. and into the middle of the night, with the trips coordinated through a dispatch center in Omaha, Nebraska. And since theres no quiet zone in the area, which is part of the Warm Springs Subdivision, McMahan said crews are required to blow the horn as they approach several crossings located in this corridor.

The noise has riled the local Nextdoor community and prompted several people to complain to Councilman Raul Peralezs office.

In 2016, residents faced a similar, albeit temporary, situation when trains were rerouted. At the time, Peralez urged Union Pacific to notify communities before blaring through. But that didnt happen.

The community was not notified and neither was our office, said Christina Ramos, Peralezs chief of staff.

McMahan acknowledged as much, which angers the councilman.

As a downtown resident, I also hear and am annoyed by the disruptive late-night Union Pacific horns, Peralez said. As a council member, I am frustrated with the lack of local, state and federal control over private railroad companies.

The City Council doesnt have jurisdiction over Union Pacific, so getting the noise to stop isnt an easy task. It is possible for cities to establish quiet zones but Union Pacific thinks they compromise safety and cities are often required to add extra safety measures like gates and medians before Union Pacific will lay off the horn.

Peralezs office has reached out to the citys Department of Transportation about the possibility of establishing a quiet zone downtown. But those conversations are in the early stage and his office is warning residents that any change will take funding and time.

A spokesman for Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren said Friday she plans to send a letter to Union Pacific, the city of San Jose and the Federal Railroad Administration strongly encouraging them to work collaboratively on this in an expedited manner to address the concerns her constituents have voiced.

In the meantime, residents may want to invest in earplugs.

SOUTH BEND

There are no arcade games, free lunches, massage therapists or other cool perks at Goodwill Industries of Michiana, otherwise staples of Google's northern California mega campus

But for the past month, a couple of Google employees from Silicon Valley have been braving some pretty awful weather - even by our standards - to help Goodwill improve its overall efficiency so it can do an even better job providing job-training services throughout the region.

It's no small task for Google data analyst Audris Teh and software engineer John Han. After all, Goodwill of Michiana operates more than 20 retail locations throughout a region that stretches from southeastern Chicago to Elkhart and from Niles down to Rochester.

The money the stores generate is used to support job-training services at the core of Goodwill's mission. In 2018, the non-profit agency reported it helped more than 14,000 people through job assistance and even the adult high schools it operates.

Teh and Han are part of a team of Google volunteers spending a month at 10 Goodwill locations across the country with the purpose of improving the efficiency and ultimately the job-training capabilities of the organization.

""They're trying to make the data we collect more consistent and useful,"" said Carrie Lee, a grant writer for Goodwill of Michiana.

If the efficiency of store operations is improved, Goodwill could theoretically have more money available for services. If its job data is more uniform, the organization might notice a particular location stands out because of its superior job-performance outcomes.

And what that location is doing could then be analyzed and modeled by other Goodwill locations across the country, said Lee.

""We're basically trying to improve our efficiency and provide better measurements of our impact in the communities we serve,"" she explained.

Before coming to South Bend, Teh and Han, who are both University of Michigan graduates, spent a month working with Goodwill in Tacoma, Wash., and will move to Kalamazoo for a month when their work wraps up here today.

Both said they have enjoyed the opportunity to apply their skills to a new field.

""It's been fun to do something different,"" Han said.

Teh said it's been especially gratifying working for a non-profit that aims to improve the lives of individuals through job training and other services.

Beyond its work helping Goodwill make its job-training data more useful, Google also has helped the organization with its digital training tools, which are used to teach people the skills that are increasingly necessary to succeed in today's economy.

Lee said Goodwill is hoping to have some of the results of Google's analysis later this year. At that time, the local organization would hope to start applying what it learned to its operations throughout the region.",137,The Electronic Frontier Foundation,14-Mar-19,The Foilies - 2019;,2842,Lewiston Morning Tribune (idaho),A_and_e,"The Foilies - 2019;

The cause of government transparency finally broke through to the popular consiousness this year. It wasn't an investigative journalism exposМ© or a civil rights lawsuit that did it, but a lighthearted sitcom about a Taiwanese-American family set in Orlando, Fla., in the late 1990s.

In a January episode of ABC's ""Fresh Off the Boat,"" the Huang family's two youngest children  overachievers Evan and Emery  decide if they sprint on all their homework, they'll have time to plan their father's birthday party.

""Like the time we knocked out two English papers, a science experiment, and built the White House out of sugar cubes,"" Evan said. ""It opened up our Sunday for filing Freedom of Information requests.""

""They may not have figured out who shot JFK,"" Emery added. ""But we will.""

The eldest child, teenage slacker Eddie, concluded with a sage nod, ""You know, once in a while, it's good to know nerds.""

Amen to that. Around the world, nerds of all ages are using laws like the United States' Freedom of Information Act (and state-level equivalent laws) to pry free secrets and expose the inner workings of our democracy. Each year, open government advocates celebrate these heroes during Sunshine Week, an annual advocacy campaign on transparency.

But the journalists and researchers who rely on these important measures every day can't help but smirk at the boys' scripted innocence. Too often, government officials will devise novel and outrageous ways to reject requests for information or otherwise stymie the public's right to know. Even today  20 years after the events set in the episode  the White House continues to withhold key documents from the Kennedy assassination files.

Since 2015, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (a nonprofit that advocates for free speech, privacy and government transparency in the digital age) has published the Foilies to recognize the bad actors who attempted to thwart the quests for truth of today's Evans and Emerys. With these tongue-in-cheek awards, the foundation calls out attempts to block transparency, retaliation against those who exercise their rights to information, and the most ridiculous examples of incompetence by government officials who handle these public records.

The following are some of this year's awards. More can be found with this story online at inland360.com.

The Corporate Eclipse Award      Google, Amazon and Facebook

Sunshine laws? Tech giants think they can just blot those out with secretive contracts. But two nonprofit groups  Working Partnerships and the First Amendment Coalition  are fighting this practice in California by suing the city of San Jose over an agreement with Google that prevents city officials from sharing the public impacts of development deals, circumventing the California Public Records Act.

Google's proposed San Jose campus is poised to have a major effect on the city's infrastructure, Bloomberg reported. Yet, according to the organization's lawsuit, records analyzing issues of public importance such as traffic impacts and environmental compliance were among the sorts of discussions Google demanded be made private under their nondisclosure agreements.

And it's not just Google using these tactics. An agreement between Amazon and Virginia includes a provision that the state will give the corporate giant which is placing a major campus in the state  a heads-up when anyone files a public records request asking for information about them. The Columbia Journalism Review reported Facebook also has used this increasingly common strategy for companies to keep cities quiet and the public in the dark about major construction projects.

The (Harlem) Shaky Grounds for Redaction Award  Federal Communications Commission

After repealing the Open Internet Order and ending net neutrality, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai doubled down on his efforts to ruin online culture. He released a cringe-inducing YouTube video titled ""7 Things You Can Still Do on the Internet After Net Neutrality"" that featured his own rendition of the infamous ""Harlem Shake"" meme. (For the uninitiated, the meme is characterized by one person subtly dancing in a room of people to Baauer's track ""Harlem Shake."" Then the bass drops and the crowd goes nuts, often with many people in costumes.)

Muckrock editor JPat Brown filed a Freedom of Information Act request for emails related to the video, but the FCC rejected the request, claiming the communications were protected ""deliberative"" records.

Brown appealed the decision, and the FCC responded by releasing all the email headers, while redacting the contents, claiming that anything more would cause ""foreseeable harm."" Brown did not relent, and a year later the FCC capitulated and released the unredacted emails.

""So, what did these emails contain that was so potentially damaging that it was worth risking a potential FOIA lawsuit over?"" Brown writes. ""Pai was curious when it was going live, and the FCC wanted to maintain a veto power over the video if they didn't like it."" The most ridiculous redaction of all was a tiny black box in an email from the FCC media director. Once removed, all that was revealed was a single word: ""OK.""

The Unreliable Narrator Award  President Donald Trump, the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. District Court Judges

When President Trump tweets attacks about the intelligence community, transparency groups and journalists often file FOIA requests (and subsequently lawsuits) seeking the documents that underpin his claims. The question that often comes up: Do Trump's smartphone rants break the seal of secrecy on confidential programs?

The answer seems to be no. Multiple judges have sided with Justice Department lawyers, concluding that his Twitter disclosures do not mean that the government has to confirm or deny whether records about those activities exist.

In a FOIA case seeking documents that would show whether Trump is under investigation, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said that the President's tweets to that effect are ""speculation."" Similarly, in a FOIA suit to get more information about the widely publicized dossier of potential ties between Trump and Russia, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said that the president's statements are political rather than ""assertions of pure fact.""

And so, whether Trump actually knows what he's talking about remains an open question.

The Cross-Contamination Award      Stanford Law Professor Daniel Ho

One of the benefits of public records laws is they allow almost anyone regardless of legal acumen  to force government agencies to be more transparent, usually without having to file a lawsuit.

But in Washington state, filing a public records request can put the requester at legal risk of being named in a lawsuit should someone else not want the records to be made public.

This is what happened to Sarah Schacht, a Seattle-based open government advocate and consultant. For years Schacht has used public records to advocate for better food safety rules in King County, an effort that led to the adoption of food safety placards found in restaurants in the region.

After Schacht filed another round of requests with the county health department, she received a legal threat in November 2018 from Stanford Law School professor Daniel Ho's attorney threatening to sue her unless she abandoned her request. Apparently, Ho has been working with the health department to study the new food safety and placard regulations. He had written draft studies that he shared with the health department, making them public records.

Ho's threat amounted to an effort to intimidate Schacht from receiving public records, probably because he had not formally published his studies first. Regardless of motive, the threat was an awful look. But even when faced with the threat, Schacht refused to abandon her request.

Fortunately, the lawsuit never materialized, and Schacht was able to receive the records. Although Ho's threats made him look like a bully, the real bad actor in this scenario is Washington state's public records law. The state's top court has interpreted the law to require parties seeking to stop agencies from releasing records (sometimes called reverse-FOIA suits) to also sue the original requester along with the government agency.

The Cash for Crash Award      Michigan State Police

As tech companies experiment with autonomous vehicles on public roadways, reporters are keeping tabs on how often these cars are involved in collisions. That's why technology industry investigator Matt Drange of the Information has been filing records requests for the crash data held by state agencies.

Some government departments have started claiming that every line of the dataset is its own, individual record and subject to a copy fee. Our winner, the Michigan State Police, proposed to charge Drange a 25-cent fee for each of a 1.9 million-line dataset, plus $20 for a thumbdrive, for a grand total of $485,645.24, with half of it due up front. Runners-up that quoted similar line-by-line charges include the Indiana State Police ($346,000) and the North Carolina Department of Transportation ($82,000). Meanwhile, Florida's government released its detailed dataset at no charge at all.

The Bartering with Extremists     Award  California Highway Patrol

In 2016, the Traditionalist Worker Party (TWP), an infamous neo-Nazi group, staged a demonstration at the California State Capitol. Counter-protesters fiercely opposed the demonstration, and the scene soon descended into chaos, leaving multiple people injured. When the dust settled, a member of the public (disclosure: also a co-author of this piece) filed a California Public Records Act request to obtain a copy of the permit the white nationalist group filed for its rally. The California Highway Patrol rejected the request for this normally available document, claiming it was related to a criminal investigation.

Two years later, evidence emerged during criminal proceedings that a highway patrol detective used the public records request as a bargaining chip in a phone call with the TWP protest leader, who was initially reluctant to provide information. The officer told him how the request might reveal his name. ""We don't have a reason to ... uh ... deny (the request),"" the officer said according a transcript of the call. But once the organizer decided to cooperate, the officer responded, ""I'm gonna suggest that we hold that or redact your name or something ... uh ... until this thing gets resolved."" In light of these new facts, the First Amendment Coalition filed a new request for the same document. It too was denied.

The Preemptive Shredding Award      Inglewood Police Department

In defiance of the law enforcement lobby, Calif-ornia legislators passed a law (SB 1421) requiring police and sheriffs to disclose officer misconduct records in response to California Public Records Act requests. These documents, often contained in personnel files, had historically been untouchable by members of the public and the press.

Almost immediately, police unions across the Golden State began to launch lawsuits to undermine these new transparency measures. But the Inglewood Police Department takes the prize for its efforts to evade scrutiny. Mere weeks before the law took effect Jan. 1, 2019, the agency began destroying records that were set to become publicly available.

""This premise that there was an intent to beat the clock is ridiculous,"" Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts Jr. told the L.A. Times in defending the purge. We imagine Butts would find it equally ridiculous to suggest that the fact he had also been a cop for more than 30 years, including serving in Inglewood and later as police chief of Santa Monica, may have factored into his support for the destruction of records.

The Least Transparent Employer     Award  U.S. Department of Justice

In the last few years, we've seen some great resignation letters from public servants, ranging from Defense Secretary James Mattis telling President Trump ""It's not me, it's you"" to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' forced resignation.

But the Trump DOJ seems to have had enough of the tradition and has now determined that U.S. Attorney resignation letters are private in their entirety and cannot be released under the Freedom of Information Act. Of course, civil servants should have their private information protected by their employer, but that's precisely what redactions should be used to protect.

Past administrations have released resignation letters that are critical of executive branch leaders. The change in policy raises the question: What are departing U.S. Attorneys now saying that the government wants to hide?

The Clawback Award      The Broward County School Board

After the tragic Parkland shooting, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel went to court to force the Broward County School Board to hand over documents detailing the shooter's education and disciplinary record. A judge agreed and ordered the release, as long as sensitive information was redacted.

But when reporters copied and pasted the file into another document, they found that the content under the redactions was still there and readable. They broke the story of how the school denied the shooter therapeutic services and alternative education accommodations, but then uploaded the school board's report with working redactions.

Rather than simply do better with double-checking their redactions next time, the school board struck back at the newspaper. They petitioned the court to hold the newspaper in contempt and to prevent anyone from reporting on the legally obtained information. Although the local judge didn't issue a fine, she lambasted the paper and threatened to dictate exactly what the paper could report about the case in the future (which is itself an unconstitutional prior restraint).

The Wrong Way to Plug a Leak Award       City of Greenfield, California

The Monterey County Weekly unexpectedly found itself in court after the city of Greenfield, California sued to keep the newspaper from publishing documents about the surprising termination of its city manager.

When Editor Sara Rubin asked the interim city manager for the complaint the outgoing city manager filed after his termination, she got nothing but crickets. But then, an envelope containing details of a potential city political scandal appeared on the doorstep of one of the paper's columnists.

The weekly reached out to the city for comment and began preparing for its normal Wednesday print deadline. Then, the morning of publication, the paper got a call saying that they were due in court. The city sued to block publication of the documents, to have the documents returned and to have the paper reveal the identity of the leaker.

Attorney Kelly Aviles of the First Amendment Coalition gave everyone a fast lesson in the First Amendment, pointing out that the paper had every right to publish. The judge ruled in the paper's favor, and the city ended up paying all of the Monterey County Weekly's attorney fees.

If it Looks like a Duck Award  Brigham Young University Police

Brigham Young University's Police Department is certified by the state,* has the powers of the state, but says that they're not actually a part of government for purposes of the Utah transparency law.

After the Salt Lake Tribune exposed that the University punished survivors of sexual assault for coming forward and reporting, the paper tried to get records of communications between the police department and the school's federally required sexual assault coordinator. BYU pushed back, saying that the police department is not subject to Utah's Government Records Access and Management Act because the police department is privately funded.

This actually turns out to be a trickier legal question than you'd expect. Brigham Young University itself isn't covered by the state law because it is a private school. But the university police force was created by an act of the Utah legislature, and the law covers entities ""established by the government to carry out the public's business."" Investigating crime and arresting people seems like the public's business.

Last summer, a judge ruled that the police department is clearly a state agency, but the issue is now on appeal at the Utah Supreme Court. Sometime this year we should learn if the police are a part of the government or not.

*Because BYU police failed to comply with state law, and was not responsive to an internal investigation, the Utah Office of Public Safety notified the department on Feb. 20 that the BYU police department will be stripped of its certification on Sept. 1, 2019. The University police also plan to appeal this decision.

THE CORPORATE ECLIPSE AWARD Google, Amazon and Facebook

But two nonprofit groups-Working Partnerships and the First Amendment Coalition-are fighting this practice in California by suing the city of San Jose over an agreement with Google that prevents city officials from sharing the public impacts of development deals, circumventing the California Public Records Act.

THE UNNECESSARY BOX SET AWARD

Central Intelligence Agency

After suing the CIA to get access to information about President Donald Trump's classified briefings, Kel McClanahan of the National Security Counselors was expecting the agency to send over eight agreed-upon documents.

What he was not expecting was for the files-between three and nine pages each-to be spread out across six separate CD-ROMs, each burned within minutes of each other, making for perhaps the most unnecessary box set in the history of the compact disc.

What makes this ""extra silly,"" McClanahan says, is that the CIA has previously complained about how burdensome and costly fulfilling requests can be. Yet the CIA could have easily combined several requests onto one disc, not to mention an email attachment. After all, a standard CD-ROM can hold 700 MB, and all of the files took only 304 KB of space.

THE (HARLEM) SHAKY GROUNDS FOR REDACTION AWARD Federal Communications Commission

After repealing the Open Internet Order and ending net neutrality, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai doubled down on his efforts to ruin online culture. He released a cringe-inducing YouTube video titled ""7 Things You Can Still Do on the Internet After Net Neutrality"" that featured his own rendition of the infamous ""Harlem Shake"" meme. (For the uninitiated, the meme is characterized by one person subtly dancing in a room of people to Baauer's track ""Harlem Shake."" Then the bass drops and the crowd goes nuts, often with many people in costumes. The actual Harlem Shake is a classier dance move that originated in a traditionally African-American neighborhood.)

Muckrock editor JPat Brown filed a Freedom of Information Act request for emails related to Pai's video, but the FCC rejected the request, claiming the communications were protected ""deliberative"" records.

Brown appealed the decision, and the FCC responded by releasing all the email headers, while redacting the contents, claiming that anything more would cause ""foreseeable harm."" Brown did not relent, and a year later the FCC capitulated and released the unredacted emails.

""So, what did these emails contain that was so potentially damaging that it was worth risking a potential FOIA lawsuit over?"" Brown writes. ""Pai was curious when it was going live, and the FCC wanted to maintain a veto power over the video if they didn't like it.""

In short: no big deal. One email, from the FCC media director, that had been redacted in full, read simply: ""OK.""

THE SCANNER DARKLY AWARD

St. Joseph County Superior Court ProPublica reporter Jessica Huseman has been digging deep into the child welfare system and what happens when child abuse results in death. While following up on a series of strangulations, she requested a copy of a case file from the St. Joseph County Superior Court in Indiana. Apparently, the clerk on the other end simply took the entire file and ran everything through a scanner. The problem was that the file contained a CD-ROM and, um, that's not how CD-ROMs work.

Nova Scotia and Halifax Law Enforcement

One Wednesday morning last April, 15 Halifax police officers raided the home of a teenage boy and his family. ""They read us our rights and told us not to talk,"" his mother would later tell CBC. ""They rifled through everything. They turned over mattresses, they took drawers and emptied out drawers, they went through personal papers, pictures. It was totally devastating and traumatic.""

Too often, government officials will devise novel and outrageous ways to reject requests for information or otherwise stymie the public's right to know. Even today--20 years after the events set in the episode--the White House continues to withhold key documents from the Kennedy assassination files.

Since 2015, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (a nonprofit that advocates for free speech, privacy and government transparency in the digital age) has published The Foilies to recognize the bad actors who attempted to thwart the quests for truth of today's Evans and Emerys. With these tongue-in-cheek awards, we call out attempts to block transparency, retaliation against those who exercise their rights to information, and the most ridiculous examples of incompetence by government officials who handle these public records.

The Corporate Eclipse Award: Google, Amazon and Facebook

Sunshine laws? Tech giants think they can just blot those out with secretive contracts. But two nonprofit groups--Working Partnerships and the First Amendment Coalition--are fighting this practice in California by suing the city of San Jose over an agreement with Google that prevents city officials from sharing the public impacts of development deals, circumventing the California Public Records Act.

Google's proposed San Jose campus is poised to have a major effect on the city's infrastructure, Bloomberg reported. Yet, according to the organization's lawsuit, records analyzing issues of public importance such as traffic impacts and environmental compliance were among the sorts of discussions Google demanded be made private under their non-disclosure agreements.

And it's not just Google using these tactics. An agreement between Amazon and Virginia includes a provision that the state will give the corporate giant--which is placing a major campus in the state--a heads-up when anyone files a public records request asking for information about them. The Columbia Journalism Review reported Facebook has also used this increasingly common strategy for companies to keep cities quiet and the public in the dark about major construction projects.

The Unnecessary Box Set Award: Central Intelligence Agency

After suing the CIA to get access to information about Trump's classified briefings, Kel McClahanan of the National Security counselors were expecting the agency to send over eight agreed-upon documents.

What he was not expecting was for the files--each between three and nine pages each--to be spread out across six separate CD-ROMs, each burned within minutes of each other, making for perhaps the most unnecessary box set in the history of the compact disc.

What makes this ""extra silly,"" McClanahan said, is that the CIA has previously complained about how burdensome and costly fulfilling requests can be. Yet the CIA could have easily combined several requests onto the same disc and saved themselves some time and resources. After all, a a standard CD-ROM can hold 700 MB, and all of the files took only 304 KB of space.

The (Harlem) Shaky Grounds for Redaction Award: Federal Communications Commission

After repealing the Open Internet Order and ending net neutrality, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai doubled down on his efforts to ruin online culture. He released a cringe-inducing YouTube video titled ""7 Things You Can Still Do on the Internet After Net Neutrality"" that featured his own rendition of the infamous ""Harlem Shake"" meme. (For the uninitiated, the meme is characterized by one person subtly dancing in a room of people to Baauer's track ""Harlem Shake."" Then the bass drops and the crowd goes nuts, often with many people in costumes.)

Muckrock editor JPat Brown filed a Freedom of Information Act request for emails related to the video, but the FCC rejected the request, claiming the communications were protected ""deliberative"" records.

Brown appealed the decision, and the FCC responded by releasing all the email headers, while redacting the contents, claiming that anything more would cause ""foreseeable harm."" Brown did not relent, and a year later the FCC capitulated and released the unredacted emails.

""So, what did these emails contain that was so potentially damaging that it was worth risking a potential FOIA lawsuit over?"" Brown writes. ""Pai was curious when it was going live, and the FCC wanted to maintain a veto power over the video if they didn't like it."" The most ridiculous redaction of all was a tiny black box in an email from the FCC media director. Once removed, all that was revealed was a single word: ""OK.""

The Unreliable Narrator Award: President Donald Trump, the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. District Court Judges

When President Trump tweets attacks about the intelligence community, transparency groups and journalists often file FOIA requests (and subsequently lawsuits) seeking the documents that underpin his claims. The question that often comes up: Do Trump's smartphone rants break the seal of secrecy on confidential programs?

The answer seems to be no. Multiple judges have sided with Justice Department lawyers, concluding that his Twitter disclosures do not mean that the government has to confirm or deny whether records about those activities exist.

In a FOIA case seeking documents that would show whether Trump is under investigation, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said that the President's tweets to that effect are ""speculation."" Similarly, in a FOIA suit to get more information about the widely publicized dossier of potential ties between Trump and Russia, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said that the President's statements are political rather than ""assertions of pure fact."" And so, whether Trump actually knows what he's talking about remains an open question.

The Cross-Contamination Award: Stanford Law Professor Daniel Ho

One of the benefits of public records laws is they allow almost anyone--regardless of legal acumen--to force government agencies to be more transparent, usually without having to file a lawsuit.

But in Washington State, filing a public records request can put the requester at legal risk of being named in a lawsuit should someone else not want the records to be made public.

This is what happened to Sarah Schacht, a Seattle-based open government advocate and consultant. For years Schacht has used public records to advocate for better food safety rules in King County, an effort that led to the adoption of food safety placards found in restaurants in the region.

After Schacht filed another round of requests with the county health department, she received a legal threat in November 2018 from Stanford Law School professor Daniel Ho's attorney threatening to sue her unless she abandoned her request. Apparently, Ho has been working with the health department to study the new food safety and placard regulations. He had written draft studies that he shared with the health department, making them public records.

Ho's threat amounted to an effort to intimidate Schacht from receiving public records, probably because he had not formally published his studies first. Regardless of motive, the threat was an awful look. But even when faced with the threat, Schacht refused to abandon her request.

Fortunately, the lawsuit never materialized, and Schacht was able to receive the records. Although Ho's threats made him look like a bully, the real bad actor in this scenario is Washington State's public records law. The state's top court has interpreted the law to require parties seeking to stop agencies from releasing records (sometimes called reverse-FOIA suits) to also sue the original requester along with the government agency.

The Scanner Darkly Award: St. Joseph County Superior Court

Propublica reporter Jessica Huseman has been digging deep into the child welfare system and what happens when child abuse results in death. While following up on a series of strangulations, she requested a copy of a case file from the St. Joseph County Superior Court in Indiana. Apparently, the clerk on the other end simply took the entire file and ran everything through a scanner. The problem was that the file contained a CD-ROM, and that's not how CD-ROMs work. ""Well this is the first time this had happened,"" Huseman posted to Twitter, along with the blotchy black-and-white image of the top of the disc. ""They scanned a CD as part of my FOI and didn't give me its contents. Cool cool.""

The Cash for Crash Award: Michigan State Police

As tech companies experiment with autonomous vehicles on public roadways, reporters are keeping tabs on how often these cars are involved in collisions. That's why The Information's Matt Drange has been filing records requests for the crash data held by state agencies. Some government departments have started claiming that every line of the dataset is its own, individual record and subject to a copy fee. Our winner, the Michigan State Police, proposed to charge Drange a 25-cent fee for each of a 1.9 million-line dataset, plus $20 for a thumbdrive, for a grand total of $485,645.24, with half of it due up front. Runners-up that quoted similar line-by-line charges include the Indiana State Police ($346,000) and the North Carolina Department of Transportation ($82,000). Meanwhile, Florida's government released its detailed dataset at no charge at all.

The Bartering with Extremists Award: California Highway Patrol

In 2016, the traditionalist Worker Party (TWP), an infamous neo-Nazi group, staged a demonstration at the California State Capitol. Counter-protesters fiercely opposed the demonstration, and the scene soon descended into chaos, leaving multiple people injured. When the dust settled, a member of the public (disclosure: also a co-author of this piece) filed a California Public Records Act request to obtain a copy of the permit the white nationalist group filed for its rally. The California Highway Patrol rejected the request for this normally available document, claiming it was related to a criminal investigation.

Two years later, evidence emerged during criminal proceedings that a CHP detective used the public records request as a bargaining chip in a phone call with the TWP protest leader, who was initially reluctant to provide information. The officer told him how the request might reveal his name. ""We don't have a reason to...uh...deny [the request],"" the officer said, according a transcript of the call. But once the organizer decided to cooperate, the officer responded, ""I'm gonna suggest that we hold that or redact your name or something...uh...until this thing gets resolved."" In light of these new facts, the First Amendment Coalition filed a new request for the same document. It too was denied.

The Preemptive Shredding Award: Inglewood Police Department

In defiance of the law enforcement lobby, California legislators passed a law (SB 1421) requiring police and sheriffs to disclose officer misconduct records in response to California Public Records Act requests. These documents, often contained in personnel files, had historically been untouchable by members of the public and the press.

Almost immediately, police unions across the Golden State began to launch lawsuits to undermine these new transparency measures. But the Inglewood Police Department takes the prize for its efforts to evade scrutiny. Mere weeks before the law took effect on Jan. 1, 2019, the agency began destroying records that were set to become publicly available.

""This premise that there was an intent to beat the clock is ridiculous,"" Inglewood Mayor James T Butts Jr. told the LA Times in defending the purge. We imagine Butts would find it equally ridiculous to suggest that the fact he had also been a cop for more than 30 years, including serving in Inglewood and later as police chief of Santa Monica, may have factored into his support for the destruction of records.

The What the Swat? Award: Nova Scotia and Halifax Law Enforcement

One Wednesday morning in April, 15 police entered the home of a teenage boy and his family.

""They read us our rights and told us not to talk,"" his mother would later tell CBC. ""They rifled through everything. They turned over mattresses, they took drawers and emptied out drawers, they went through personal papers, pictures. It was totally devastating and traumatic.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКSan Francisco has the Golden Gate Bridge. Paris has the Eiffel Tower. Now, San Jose is set to have its own landmark. (But has it learned anything from the Quetzalcoatl incident?)

San Francisco boasts the Golden Gate Bridge. New York has the Statue of Liberty. And San Josewell, it really doesnt have an iconic attraction.

But after months of planning and negotiating, thats finally set to change.

Despite pushback from environmental groups, the San Jose City Council voted Tuesday to allow a local nonprofit to hold an international competition for a landmark at Arena Green, off Santa Clara Street near the SAP Center.

The nonprofit behind the effort, the San Jose Light Tower Corporation (SJLTC), has argued that this new, distinctive, and world-class public landmark will be a gathering place that produces civic pride, spurs economic development, and is a must-see for visitors and locals alike.

Its unclear exactly what type of landmark will grace Arena Green, or when. Now with the councils approval, the SJLTC  whose executive director is Steve Borkenhagen, the downtown booster behind the now-shuttered restaurant Eulipia will move forward with the design competition and hopes to bring a final concept to the council no later than January of next year.

Back in the late 1800s and early 1900s, a 237-foot electric light tower loomed over the intersection of Market and Santa Clara streets. But it was removed after being damaged in a 1915 windstorm, and the nonprofit and the city arent interested in replicating the tower. Rather, they want artists to conceive a new homage to Silicon Valleys urban core.

But the Sierra Club, which emailed members of the Loma Prieta chapter about the proposal, and other groups are concerned that whatever ends up at Arena Green which sits where the Guadalupe River and Los Gatos Creek run together  could disturb endangered fish, migratory birds and other wildlife that rely on the park space.

This site is one of the few stretches of intact riparian corridor through downtown, Jean Dresden, the coordinator of the group San Jose Parks Advocates wrote in a letter to the council opposing the plan.

And, Dresden said, pushing a new landmark at Arena Green could make it more difficult to raise money to redevelop St. James Park downtown.

Anticipating Google campus, San Jose approves taller buildings

SJLTC has worked with environmental consultants in the wake of such concerns and will provide detailed environmental information about the site to people who enter the competition. And they will be allowed a voice in judging the design competition.

The site was selected  after an analysis by San Jose-based architecture firm Steinberg Hart  because of its size, its location between downtown and the Diridon Station area, which will become home to a massive Google campus in the coming years, and its proximity to public transportation.

Still, not everyone thinks the city should give up so much control.

One resident who wrote to the council cautioned the city could see something like the citys statue of Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec god. A coiled serpent, many residents say the piece looks like a pile of dog poop  and think it was the artists attempt to get revenge after the city accepted and then ultimately rejected the sculptors earlier work for a separate project.

Lets learn from this monumental mistake, the resident said. Lets not have an iconic Quetzalcoatl Light Tower foisted on us by any committee, no matter how international or prestigious.",141,Emily Deruy,13-Mar-19,"San Jose: Anticipating Google Campus, City Council Approves Taller Buildings",1065,The East Bay Times (california),,"San Jose: Anticipating Google Campus, City Council Approves Taller Buildings

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe City Council voted to raise building height limits over the objections of airport commissioners.

After more than a decade of debate over how tall buildings in the nations 10th largest city should stand, San Joses notoriously squat skyline is finally set to rise in the coming years.

The ability to build upward will allow companies  particularly Google, which is planning to build a large campus west of Highway 87  access to real estate in the sky that has previously been off limits.

The City Council set the change in motion when it voted unanimously this week to allow higher buildings downtown and near Diridon Station to the west despite intense opposition from members of the airport commission and critics who worry the city is kowtowing to Google.

I think that history is going to show that this was a very devastating move for our airport, and I wish that city officials would have taken a little more time to look into this further, said Dan Connolly, the chair of the airport commission.

Taller buildings are essential to creating a more vibrant and urban downtown, said Matt Mahood, the president of the Silicon Valley Organization, a business advocacy group.

Under the new height limits, officially known as Scenario 4, buildings downtown could rise between 5 and 35 feet, or a modest couple of stories. But near the SAP Center, which is 110 feet tall, heights could more than double, going up 70 to 150 feet. That, the city says, could add about 9.5 million more square feet of commercial and residential development. It likely will be years before residents see the taller structures, but the vote signals the coming of a major change in the density of the citys core.

I think this is about what kind of city do we want to create, Mayor Sam Liccardo said. This is about our vision for the future of the city.

The citys airport executives and top economic development officials say allowing taller buildings will bring new jobs, retail and housing to San Jose and inject new life into a long-overlooked industrial area south of the airport.

Scott Knies, the head of the San Jose Downtown Association, said the council has opened the doors for the biggest change in a generation and fixed stifling policy. Downtown where construction costs and the price of land are sky high, Knies continued, a couple of stories could mean the difference between a developer deciding to move forward with a project and calling it off.

And, Knies said, allowing Google and other developers to put office space and housing up in the air clears the way for parks and public art and other amenities residents can enjoy on the ground.

David Bini, the executive director of the local Building and Construction Trades Council, agreed.

More construction means more construction jobs, Bini said.

But pilots on the airport commission say it could make flying less safe and relegate San Jose International Airport (SJC) to a middling airport.

Our conclusion, which the majority of the Airport Commission agreed with when we reconvened on 1/24/19, is that if the council adopts Scenario 4, it will render SJC as a regional airport, putting flights to Asia, European and some transcontinental flights in financial jeopardy, wrote Ken Pyle, one of the commissioners.

International and other long flights might not be financially worthwhile for airlines under the new rules, they warn, because taller structures could force some airlines to remove passengers or luggage on those flights to make sure planes are light enough to still clear buildings in case of an emergency and they lose an engine.

Liccardo and several council members  including Vice Mayor Chappie Jones, Councilman Raul Peralez and Councilwoman Magdalena Carrasco  have hit back at the allegations, particularly those related to safety.

We want to emphasize that these recommendations do not in any way pertain to safety, they wrote in a memo ahead of the vote.

Some commissioners, including Connolly and Cathy Hendrix, have questioned how much influence Google has had in pushing the city toward taller buildings and are outraged that a steering committee put together to consider the issue included Mahood, Bini and Knies but not an active commercial airline pilot. The tech giant has snapped up some 50 acres near Diridon Station and will benefit significantly by being able to build not only out, but up.

We have a commission system in the city that, honestly, I dont think is valued by the city or the elected officials, Connolly said. Im not sure why on issues that are so important the airport commission didnt get the opportunity to be fully engaged from the start.

Google  whose San Jose development is referred to as Project Spartan in a city contract  and its consultant have been in regular contact with city officials and the consulting firm the city hired to study height limits.

Some of those concerns have been taken up by opponents of Google, like the grassroots group Serve the People, who dont want to see the tech giant build a campus in San Jose.

Corruption, negligence, and a lack of concern for SOME of our lives have marked this dirty deal from the start, the group said in a tweet.

But some other labor groups that have raised concerns about Google in the past and council members who have been receptive to those concerns indicated they were open to working out a compromise that could add affordable housing.

Councilman Sergio Jimenez suggested the city allow developers that are willing to provide affordable housing or other community benefits to build higher.

The labor-backed group Working Partnerships USA endorsed the idea, saying the policy would help protect residents from being displaced.

By developing an incentive zoning policy, we can ensure that the benefits of the (upzoning) of Diridon Station and the downtown core does not only benefit developers, landowners and corporations like Google, Jeffrey Buchanan, the organizations director of public policy, wrote in a letter to the council, but ultimately benefits the citys residents by generating community benefits like producing and preserving affordable housing and addressing displacement.",142,Anonymous,13-Mar-19,The Foilies 3019,4092,Flagpole,Pg. 8 Vol. 33 No. 10,"The Foilies 3019

Recognizing the Years Worst in Government Transparency

The cause of government transparency finally broke through to the popular Zeitgeist this year. It wasn't an investigative journalism expose or a civil rights lawsuit that did it, but a lighthearted sitcom about a Taiwanese-American family set in Orlando, FL, in the late 1990s.

In a January episode of ABC's Fresh Off the Boat, the Huang family's two youngest children, overachievers Evan and Emery, decide if they sprint to finish their homework, they'll have time to plan their father's birthday party.

""Like the time we knocked out two English papers, a science experiment and built the White House out of sugar cubes,"" Evan said. ""It opened up our Sunday for filing Freedom of Information requests.""

""They may not have figured out who shot JFK,"" Emery added, ""but we will.""

The eldest child, teenage slacker Eddie, concluded with a sage nod, ""You know, once in a while, it's good to know nerds.""

Amen to that. Around the world, nerds of all ages are using laws like the United States' Freedom of Information Act (and state-level equivalent laws) to pry free secrets and expose the inner workings of our democracy. Each year, open-government advocates celebrate these heroes during Sunshine Week, an annual advocacy campaign on transparency.

But the journalists and researchers who rely on these important measures every day can't help but smirk at the boys' scripted innocence. Too often, government officials will devise novel and outrageous ways to reject requests for information or otherwise stymie the public's right to know. Even today - 20 years after the events set in the episode - the White House continues to withhold key documents from the Kennedy assassination files.

Since 2015, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for free speech, privacy and government transparency in the digital age, has published The Foilies to recognize the bad actors who attempted to thwart the quests for truth of today's Evans and Emerys.

THE INTERN ART PROJECT AWARD:

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott

Seattle isn't the only city to stumble in response to Chapman's public records requests for email metadata. The Vermont governor's office also wins for its scissor-and-glue approach to releasing electronic information.

Rather than export the email information as a spreadsheet, the governor's office told Chapman it had five interns, three of whom were unpaid, working six hours each, literally ""cutting and pasting the emails from paper copies."" Next thing Chapman knew, he had a 43-page hodgepodge collage of email headers correlating with one day's worth of messages. The governor's attorney told Chapman it would cost $1,200 to process three more days' worth of emails.

Chapman pushed back and provided his own instructions on exporting the data using a computer and not, you know, scissors and glue. Sure enough, he received a 5,500-line spreadsheet a couple weeks later at no charge.

THE (HARLEM) SHAKY GROUNDS FOR REDACTION AWARD:

Federal Communications Commission

After repealing the Open Internet Order and ending net neutrality, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai doubled down on his efforts to ruin online culture. He released a cringe-inducing YouTube video titled ""7 Things You Can Still Do on the Internet After Net Neutrality"" that featured his own rendition of the infamous ""Harlem Shake"" meme.

THE UNRELIABLE NARRATOR AWARD:

When President Trump tweets attacks about the intelligence community, transparency groups and journalists often file FOIA requests (and, subsequently, lawsuits) seeking the documents that underpin his claims.

""It's an exciting next step for me with TMG expanding the already well-established presence they have in the South Bay,"" Kochalski said, adding that he was ""very thankful"" for his time at John Buck Co. ""I'm just excited about all the opportunities given the tenant demand in the market and the amount of product.""

He'll take on the new role as partner in mid-April.

Kochalski will be primarily focused on expanding TMG's business in the region, including new acquisitions and development opportunities. He'll be working from TMG's San Francisco offices before the company establishes a presence in the South Bay. TMG is looking for South Bay space now, he said.

TMG is working with Boston Properties on Platform 16, a 1.1 million-square-foot office development in San Jose's Diridon Station area. The project at 440 W. Julian St. is not far from where Google is planning a massive new corporate campus oriented around the Diridon transit hub and comes as major developers are flocking to San Jose.

TMG's other flagship properties are in San Francisco and Oakland, where the developer has been buying up or repositioning office buildings. Overall, TMG has developed more than 30 million square feet in the Bay Area.

In San Francisco, Kochalski led a number of high-profile projects, including Park Tower and One Steuart Lane. He joins TMG as a partner after eight years at John Buck Co., where he oversaw the San Francisco office and spent five years guiding the Park Tower development in the Transbay district to fruition. Facebook signed the biggest lease in San Francisco history for all of Park Tower last May. He also oversaw the development of One Steuart Lane, 120 high-end condos at 75 Howard St. on the Embarcadero that are now under construction.

""Ben's combination of market knowledge, development strategy and entrepreneurial aptitude is the precise addition to our team,"" said TMG's Chairman and CEO Michael Covarrbuias in a statement.

Before John Buck Co., Kochalski was a director with InSite Real Estate and several construction companies. He attended the Ohio State University and received an M.B.A. from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.

It's been a little more than a year since the onetime Brocade Communications Systems property in North San Jose traded hands, but in that time the 600,400-square-foot campus has nearly doubled in value to investors.

A Japanese investment and development company, Mori Trust, purchased the three-building, 9.72-acre property at 110-130 Holger Way this week for $429 million, according to Santa Clara County documents. The deal works out to $714.52 per square foot, or about $44 million per acre for the campus.

The seller was Menlo Park-based Lane Partners, which purchased the property from Brocade in December 2017 for $225.5 million, or $375.58 per square foot. The property deal with Brocade was in the works as the tech company prepared for a long-anticipated acquisition by Broadcom Ltd., and closed shortly after the takeover was finalized.

Since then, the campus has been a major boon for Lane Partners. Brocade moved out of the buildings - its onetime headquarters - and within six months Lane Partners had inked a lease with chipmaker Micron Technology for the full campus, which includes one building that can serve as office space or a data center and a five-story parking structure with 1900 spots.

Micron plans to sublease one of the buildings in the near-term, a spokesperson for the semiconductor company told the Business Journal last summer.

But even with a new tenant or two, Lane Partners Principal Mark Murray told the Business Journal last year he didn't expect that the buildings would need much work. The company primarily invested in landscaping and outdoor amenities, improvements that rang in at around the $2 million mark.

""The quality of the buildings, particularly the interior improvements, are really what drove us to acquire this campus,"" Murray told the Business Journal after the company closed on the campus in 2017.

The property, now known as HQ @ First, has been on the market for sale since September, according to industry insiders. Murray did not respond to several requests for comment on the deal this week. Newmark Knight Frank's NorCal Capital Markets team advised on the sale, according to a Newmark spokesperson.

North San Jose's rise

North San Jose, once relegated as a space for low-slung industrial and manufacturing buildings, has seen enormous activity when it comes to leasing and sales, drawing major interest from investors and tenants. Apple, Google and Microsoft all own property in the area.

Google has purchased multiple properties in the area in the past year or two, including two newly renovated buildings last October at 4300 and 4400 North First St. for $154.5 million, or about $410 per square foot.

PSAI Realty Partners spent 91.5 million to buy the Gold Street Technology Center where TiVo Corp has long kept its headquarters in North San Jose last summer in a deal that worked out to about $302 per square foot.

And last week, San Jose-based Toeniskoetter Development Inc. closed on a two-building campus at 2460 and 2480 North First St. for $54.1 million, or about $366 per square foot.

While North San Jose has gained significant momentum when it comes to investors, tenants and developers, Mori Trust's purchase ranks among the most expensive deals on a per-square-foot basis in recent history. But that's not entirely surprising, says Drew Arvay, managing director for Cushman & Wakefield.

""There tends to be a movement that high-quality real estate with long term income is getting a premium and there's not a lot for sale,"" he said. ""The country is hungry for West Coast real estate because they think it has the best value growth.""

The bulk of the Japanese developer's portfolio is in Tokyo, but Mori Trust entered the U.S. market in early 2017, when it bought two office buildings in Boston for $673 million.

HIGHLIGHT:еКIn what's believed to be Silicon Valley's biggest property deal so far in 2019, Mori Trust, a Japan-based developer and real estate investor known for constructing the Roppongi Hills mixed-use complex in central Tokyo, has paid $429 million in cash for a big north San Jose office campus that's leased to Micron Technology.

SAN JOSE  A famed developer from Japan has bought a big tech campus in north San Jose in a head-spinning Silicon Valley mega-deal valued at $429 million.

Mori Trust, a Japan-based developer and real estate investor that has begun to purchase properties in the United States, is the new owner of the San Jose tech campus, according to several sources with knowledge of the transaction.

The campus, which is fully leased to Micron Technology, was bought on March 11 for $429 million in cash, Santa Clara County property records show. The deal is believed to be Silicon Valleys largest property purchase so far in 2019.

At a high level, this deal shows the interest on the part of global investors in Silicon Valley, the worlds premier technology market, said Eric Fox, executive managing director with Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm.

The deal also underscores the growing strength of the north San Jose market, which has begun to attract a steady stream of tech company leases and property purchases, as well as an influx of dollars from realty investors.

This really speaks to the success of north San Jose and everything that is going on there, Fox said.

The complex consists of 604,000 square feet of offices and a multi-level parking garage. It is located on Holger Way near the interchange of State Route 237 and Zanker Road. In July 2018, Micron Technology struck a deal to rent the entire complex.

At the time of the lease, Micron had 600 employees in nondescript Milpitas buildings and anticipated it would move about 1,000 employees into the striking new San Jose offices, which sport prominent Micron logos.

Over the 12 months that ended in November, Boise, Idaho-based Micron earned $14.75 billion on revenue of $31.5 billion, according to the Yahoo Finance site. The company is a powerhouse in providing chips for an array of uses, including mobile devices, artificial intelligence and other fast-expanding applications such as autonomous vehicles.

Several sources familiar with the deal confirmed that Mori Trust of Tokyo was the buyer. Mori Trust used an affiliate called MT Silicon Valley One to complete the purchase. The seller, Bay Area developer Lane Partners, declined to discuss the transaction.

A Newmark Knight Frank Capital Markets brokerage team of Steven Golubchik, Ramsey Daya and Edmund Najera were advisers on the transaction.

The purchase price of $429 million appears to represent a significant profit for Bay Area development firm Lane Partners. Menlo Park-based Lane bought the office campus in 2017 for $225.5 million from Brocade Communications, which had just merged with Broadcom.

The deal also is a reminder that plenty of tech companies beyond Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon are in big-time growth mode in Silicon Valley.

Other big north San Jose complexes have been grabbed by investors in recent months.

On Jan. 25, an affiliate of San Francisco Prosperity paid $47.8 million for a two-building office complex totaling 101,000 square feet on Orchard Parkway. On March 7, an affiliate of Toeniskoetter Development paid $54.1 million for two buildings totaling 148,000 square feet located at 2460 N. First St. and 2480 N. First St. near Component Drive.

But the $429 million purchase of the Holger Way campus is far larger, by magnitudes, and could be the biggest recorded deal in the Bay Area since last November, when Google paid $1 billion for a large tech campus in Mountain View a short distance from its Googleplex headquarters.

The deal also provides fresh validation of years-long efforts to create a village of office buildings, homes, hotels and retail in the area, including a Target store. Development of a coherent mixed-use project, which was called @First, was envisioned originally by Hunter Properties principal executive Deke Hunter.

It took a lot of vision for a long time to make this happen, Fox said. It proved the idea of high-density development in north San Jose.",146,,11-Mar-19,"Held Properties Sells 67k Sf Flex Building In North San Jose, Ca For $19 Million",204,Plus Company Updates(pcu),,"Held Properties Sells 67k Sf Flex Building In North San Jose, Ca For $19 Million

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe new sensor division will compete with the world's biggest lidar producer, San Jose-based Velodyne Lidar, in what has become a billion-dollar industry.

Alphabet's self-driving car unit, Waymo, is getting into the sensor business.

Waymo said Wednesday it would begin selling the laser-mapping sensors used on its driverless vehicles to other companies as long as the customers don't compete with its core robotaxi business. The sensors, known as lidar, shoot lasers off objects to determine what's nearby. The next generation of warehouse robots, security systems, and even autonomous tractors could all be built with this technology.

Waymo, which began as Google's self-driving car project in 2009, is widely considered the leader in autonomous vehicles. It launched the first commercial self-driving car service late last year in the suburbs of Phoenix and now says it has ""several hundred"" riders enrolled. The new sensor division will compete with the world's biggest lidar producer, San Jose-based Velodyne Lidar, in what has become a billion-dollar industry.

For Waymo, however, the strategy isn't simply to generate revenue. The sensor hardware for autonomous vehicles is made in-house by Waymo, which means increased production should lower costs.

""As we scale our fleet and build more cars, we need to make sure the cost of the sensor suite comes down as well,"" Simon Verghese, the head of Waymo's lidar team, said in an interview. ""We're excited to see what people might do with this and to explore whether some of these spinoff technologies give us another pillar to our business.""

A Waymo spokesperson said the company is now in talks with dozens of potential customers.

Even though the self-driving cars most often associated with lidar technology have only just started appearing on public roads, lidar has already found its way into the wild to help to collect trash, sweep streets and pilot drones. Retailers such as Walmart and grocery store chain Stop & Shop are using lidar-equipped robots to help keep shelves stocked. A security company called Knightscope uses lidar to help patrol malls and parking lots.

These sensors can create a precise 3D view of the world, identify humans, categorize objects and anticipate movement. The overall market for lidar is doubling annually and will top $1 billion in 2019, said Frank Bertini, Velodyne's head of lidar sales for non-automotive applications. Most of the market is for self-driving cars but roughly a tenth of the sensors end up in emerging industrial and commercial applications.

The development curve is similar to Moore's Law in computer chips: Every 18 months, lidar sensor resolution doubles and the price drops by half. ""That whole cost curve and drive of volume is what's opening new industries,"" Bertini said in an interview, before learning of Waymo's plans. ""Right now the market can support more lidar manufacturers because the demand is outpacing supply. That's why you're seeing elevated prices.""

When Google first set out to develop self-driving cars 10 years ago, it cobbled together sensors and software from a variety of different manufacturers. Integration proved overly complicated, so in 2011 the company decided to develop its own hardware and software in house.

""Then something interesting happened,"" said Waymo's Verghese. ""Other teams at Google started asking us if they could get their hands on our products."" In an interview with Bloomberg in 2017, Waymo Chief Executive Officer John Krafcik indicated that he would consider selling hardware in the future.

There are three types of sensors used in Waymo's self-driving cars: the 360-degree bubble that sits on the roof, like a top hat; a long-range, forward-facing sensor; and a short-range sensor that monitors the car's perimeter. The last of these is known as the Laser Bear Honeycomb and is the only one that Waymo is ready to sell to outside companies.

The device - named for its development team, Laser Bear, as well as the shape of the sensor when it isn't spinning - is the most useful in Waymo's suite of sensors for non-automotive applications. It has a wide field of vision that can quickly map out an entire room and was designed specifically to ensure Waymo cars have no blind spots, even very close to the car and near the ground.

Verghese said Waymo hasn't ruled out selling sensors to automotive suppliers in the future. It would be a ""huge overhead and a different way of doing business,"" he said. Waymo will provide sensor customers with integrated software and some software support, but Verghese said it isn't interested in becoming an ""all-out lidar company.""

Waymo wouldn't disclose how much it plans to charge for the Honeycomb. The closest comparable sensor made by Veloydne"" the recently unveiled VelaDome short-range lidar"" is priced at roughly $4,000 for a single sensor and half that when purchased in bulk. Velodyne said it will sell more than 10,000 lidar units this year.

Lidar works by spinning out a fine spray of laser light and measuring the time it takes for the light to return. The Honeycomb can see about 30 feet ahead on a flat surface, or double that when facing down a slope, and sends out laser pulses in a 360-degree horizontal field of view and a 95-degree vertical view.

Each blast of laser sends back multiple readings, allowing a Waymo vehicle to identify a leaf blowing on a tree branch, as well as a child standing behind the tree and getting ready to step into traffic. Repeat that process over hundreds of thousands of light pulses per second and a dynamic 3D view of the world emerges. The same technology could be used to distinguish employees from objects in a warehouse or to help a ""smart forklift"" determine the orientation of an object it's trying to pick up.

Every Waymo vehicle has four Honeycomb sensors. ""We'd really like this to be our most cost-effective sensor,"" Verghese said. ""Getting some scale out of some of these adjacent markets as we're scaling our self-driving fleet, the timing just works out very well. It looks like most of these other applications can pretty much use the lidar as it is.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe San Jose City Council outlined a list of policy priorities for the coming year on Tuesday.

Setting their top priorities for the coming year, the San Jose City Council has agreed to tackle wide-ranging polices from adopting a paid family leave policy to making it easier for people to build granny flats.

On Tuesday, the San Jose City Council approved a set of policy priorities including those above  for the year ahead. While its not binding and doesnt preclude the council from taking on other issues, the framework provides a snapshot of what elected officials in the nations 10th largest city want to accomplish in the months to come.

City manager David Sykes acknowledged that the policy priority setting process has been viewed in the past as where potential policies go to die, but said his team is committed to moving the councils priorities forward.

First published in 2011 amid budget cuts that limited the citys ability to take on new proposals, the council has updated the list periodically, most recently in October 2017 when lawmakers settled on a list of 27 priorities. Since then, the city managers chief of staff Lee Wilcox wrote in a recent memo, the city has finished work on five priorities, including updating the citys rental rights and referrals program and creating a medical marijuana framework. By the end of this fiscal year, the city anticipates completing another five items, including formalizing a safe parking program for homeless people who sleep in their cars.

Overall, council members submitted more than two dozen policy priorities for consideration, from adding more public art downtown to providing storage lockers for homeless people where they can store their belongings. Those two priorities ultimately didnt make the cut.

Mayor Sam Liccardo proposed creating a universal development fee to give builders in San Jose a clearer understanding of what they stand to pay the city. Councilwomen Magdalena Carrasco and Pam Foley, meanwhile, want to make it easier for people to build granny flats, formally known as accessory dwelling units, on their property. Councilwoman Sylvia Arenas pushed the family leave policy issue. All those proposals made it through.

Choosing between priorities, Carrasco joked, was like trying to pick a favorite child.

Theyre very difficult to choose among, Carrasco said.

The councils decision to publicly rank priorities also gave residents and different advocacy groups in the city a chance to make their cases for various proposals.

The South Bay Piping Industry Labor Management Trust, for instance, penned a letter to the council urging members to strengthen protections against wage theft.

Assemblyman Ash Kahlra, a former councilman, agreed, writing, especially with the recent horrific events associated with the Silvery Towers construction project, we must now do more to ensure that major construction projects and public works contractors are held accountable for the fair treatment and fair wages of their employees.

Matt Mahood, the president and CEO of the Silicon Valley Organization endorsed the idea of a universal development fee, writing, Currently, development fees are extremely difficult to estimate and fees are often set without oversight or coordination between city departments.

Mahood and several other groups also backed a proposal from the mayor to promote the building of childcare and early education facilities.

All of those proposals made the cut, along with plans to make sure people across the city have access to opportunities in the cannabis industry.

But some groups were disappointed. Environmental groups pushed back at the elimination of a previous priority, riparian corridor and bird-safe design, to make room for new priorities.

HIGHLIGHT:еКActivism at Google and Amazon paid off. But can the emerging ""tech left"" forge long-term alliances between janitors, drivers, and engineers?

https://live-thenation.pantheon.io/article/tech-workers-google-facebook-protest- dsa/

On a Thursday night late last year, a dozen or so people gathered in the women's Building, a community center in San Francisco's Mission District, to attend an employment-law seminar hosted by the Tech Workers Coalition (TWC). The group, founded five years ago, helps organize workers and trains them to ask for better conditions, treatment, and pay across the booming technology industry. This particular gathering drew an Uber driver, a contractor with Apple, a former Google employee, and two people from Square, the mobile-payments system. Beth Ross, one of the Bay Area's fiercest pro-labor attorneys, and Veena Dubal, a labor-law scholar at UC Hastings, held court before the small crowd. ""There's a lot of solidarity to be built here,"" said Dubal, who was dressed in business-casual. ""A worker is a worker.""1

Their talk was about how corporations routinely misclassify workers as ""independent contractors,"" denying them regular employment benefits and making it harder to organize-a practice that, per Ross, ""undermines workers' solidarity across industries."" Ross, who's in her 50s, is best known for winning a multimillion-dollar settlement from a San Francisco strip club after it reclassified its dancers as free agents in 1994 and began charging them a nightly $125 stage fee. In a more recent case, the California Supreme Court narrowed the definition of what constitutes an ""independent contractor,"" which, Ross said, could present opportunities for contract tech workers to win a broader set of employment and workplace protections.2

An intense speaker with brown hair and dark-rimmed glasses, Ross has the confident bearing of a champion litigator. Bosses in every industry, she said, try to cut costs by misclassifying their employees; the only difference between strippers and tech workers is ""what they wear-or don't wear-on the job.""3

The assembled workers peppered the lawyers with legal questions and then broke into smaller groups to discuss their motivations and swap tales of abuse. The Uber driver wanted help organizing his fellows in an industry that he said seems designed to block collective action. ""I never meet any other drivers,"" he said. ""I'm just on this app, dealing with these poverty wages alone.""4

A coder who had just finished ""boot camp""-where, in exchange for learning how to program, participants fork over a percentage of their earnings-wanted to know how to get out of the arrangement. ""That sounds like indentured servitude,"" someone muttered.5

The TWC meeting, while small, demonstrated some of the biggest difficulties of organizing workers in the digital economy. Work-related grievances are linked yet frustratingly atomized; disparities in pay within a company can be as extreme as the ones in the world they inhabit. And as ordinary people around the world grow disillusioned with the power of Big Tech, the workers who keep the floors clean, the cafeteria stocked, and the servers running at these companies are struggling to find a common grammar to make sense of what they owe not just to their communities, but also to each other.6

major challenge for the emerging tech-labor movement today happens to be its biggest advantage as well: The definition of a ""tech worker"" is broad, almost to the point of being meaningless. Working ""in tech"" could conceivably mean doing anything on the Internet, or with computers or smartphones or anything that plugs into a wall. This, in turn, means there are far more potential recruits for the labor movement. But while software engineers and Uber drivers may get their paychecks from the same pot of corporate money, their experiences, problems, and approaches to solving them aren't necessarily aligned.7

This is especially important today, because somewhere between the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Google's secret plan to build a censored search engine for the authoritarian Chinese government, and Amazon's recent ouster from the New York City borough of Queens, Silicon Valley has lost its air of invincibility, opening up new possibilities for organizing in the workplace.8

To take some recent examples: In late 2018, Somali workers at an Amazon warehouse in Minneapolis forced the company to the negotiating table. The staff at Palantir demanded that their CEO stop working with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Microsoft employees presented their bosses with a petition, signed by 300,000 people, to protest the company's work facilitating immigrant detention. And the year was capped off by a massive international walkout at Google, accompanied by an aggressive list of demands that ranged from placing a workers' representative on the board to overhauling sexual-harassment protocols. Wiredcalled it ""The Year Tech Workers Realized They Were Workers.""9

TWC, an all-volunteer organization that lacks the structure or leadership hierarchies of a traditional labor union, is trying to ride this wave of dissent. With chapters in Seattle, New York, and Boston, its members help coordinate labor actions across companies and mobilize cadres of workers on the inside. In the Bay Area, TWC held five separate events, including an introduction to the organization, a primer on labor law, and a forum to share workplace experiences-all in the first month of 2019. TWC welcomes employees of all kinds, from coders to janitors: As Moira Weigel recounted in The Guardian, the organization was formed in 2014 out of a friendship between a computer engineer and a cafeteria worker who set out to forge an alternative to the ""Californian Ideology,"" or the industry's long-standing ethos of individualism and self-reliance. Over coffee in San Francisco, a TWC volunteer who's worked as a product manager in Silicon Valley said the workforce he was part of is undergoing a fundamental shift away from an aspirational admiration for bosses and toward a deeper solidarity among colleagues. The volunteer-who requested anonymity in order to avoid retaliation from the companies he organizes in-believes that well-paid engineers will band together with lower-paid workers when they see the writing on the wall, noting: ""They need to be convinced that the way contract workers are treated now, that's how engineers will be treated in the future.""10

This philosophy-that coders, drivers, and janitors can be corralled into collective action-is hard to square with the stereotypes of libertarian Googlers cavorting at Burning Man. It's also hard to put into action for the most committed activists accustomed to more contained initiatives.11

Thom Hoffman, a longtime driver for Uber and Lyft, has become one of the Bay Area's most prominent rideshare organizers. ""Collective action, unions, building workers' power-these are the things that prevent individuals from being taken advantage of,"" he told me recently by phone.12

Hoffman, who's in his 50s, has broad shoulders and speaks with a Midwestern lilt that inflects his acquired California slang. He's the kind of rideshare driver that companies like Uber and Lyft would hold up as a testament to their own virtue: that they're simply in the business of helping people make extra cash.13

Hoffman says he took up driving to supplement an unsteady job working for a costume-and-prop company. It helped that he enjoyed the work. ""Dude, I loved driving,"" he told me. ""I was pumping it up to everyone."" That all changed in 2016, when Uber and Lyft started cutting rates in a mad scramble to eat up market share and convince would-be investors to inject cash into their still-unprofitable businesses. (Later in the year, Uber received $3.5 billion from the Saudi Arabian sovereign-wealth fund.)14

Hoffman started organizing because ""it felt like 20 to 30 percent of my paycheck was gone overnight."" More than two years before the meeting in the San Francisco women's center, he was on the streets of the East Bay helping the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, build a list of Uber drivers. He spent most of his time knocking on car windows in the Oakland airport lot where drivers congregated, slowly helping to build up a sense of common purpose.15

Hoffman made good money-up to $4,000 a month before taxes-from a major Silicon Valley company. But he saw himself as a union man, not a tech worker: ""Dad was in the carpenters' union, and Mom was a hospital aide who worked on the union drive."" In fact, when he moved to the Bay Area in 2008, he'd hoped to find steady work with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the union he'd belonged to back home in Indiana.16

Hoffman's theory of change is old-school: If enough Uber drivers decide to band together, the company will have no choice but to take their demands seriously. And he's ambivalent about the white-collar kids identifying with-and trying to organize-the drivers' struggle. ""I wish them the best,"" he says. Still, he's focusing on mobilizing other drivers.17

n the surface, Hoffman doesn't have a lot in common with Meredith Whittaker. An expert on the social impact of artificial intelligence, Whittaker has worked at Google for over a decade, earns orders of magnitude more than the average rideshare driver, and recently co-founded her own research institute at New York University. She also happens to be one of Google's fiercest and most active critics, working tirelessly to build internal resistance at the company.18

Last year, Whittaker was one of a number of Google employees to pressure the company to stop working with the Pentagon's military artifical-intelligence program, known as Project Maven. Such protests are becoming more common: In February, Microsoft workers went public to protest a $480 million contract to provide augmented-reality headsets to the US Army.19

""You can't have a company whose ultimate rationale is shareholder value making decisions about how to automate weapons,"" Whittaker says. That applies more broadly than to Google's drones: A workers' movement inside Big Tech is necessary to inject social responsibility into the industry. At Google, Whittaker explained, the company went through the motions of listening to employees by holding town halls. Company message boards allowed employees to voice dissent internally. But to halt Project Maven, Google employees also had to go public in opposition to their bosses; some even quit in protest. ""People conflated having a voice with having power,"" she noted.20

While Hoffman speaks of struggling to make the rent and afford his health insurance, Whittaker speaks of ethics and alliances. But both efforts-Hoffman's organizing of drivers, and Whittaker's solidarity-building inside Google-challenge the radical individualism that's informed so many Silicon Valley companies and organizations. And in the absence of meaningful regulation from Washington, combining these efforts seems to be the only hope of holding the Big Tech companies accountable.21

Labor scholars say they sense changes afoot. ""It's true that a libertarian ethos has been overwhelming here,"" said Harley Shaiken, a labor scholar who teaches at UC Berkeley. Shaiken predicts a reckoning between the implicit promise of working in Silicon Valley-helping to make the world a better (or at least more efficient) place-and its reality: building censored search engines for autocracies, enriching sexual harassers, and providing logistical support for family separation. ""Many went into this field with a vision of the world, and that didn't involve helping the Pentagon build drones,"" he added.22

""These companies made their names trying to change the world, but we examine the change and we think, 'We don't like it,'"" Whittaker said shortly after helping organize a massive walkout at Google in late 2018. The precipitating event was a New York Timesstory about Andy Rubin, a Google executive whom the company paid $90 million to depart after he was accused of sexual harassment. ""We are not going to play whack-a-mole with every new outrage,"" Whittaker said. ""What we are going to do is to change the system.""23

The walkout proved to be an impressive show of force: From Singapore to Dublin, thousands participated, with more than 3,000 workers in New York alone. Management quickly conceded to one of the movement's demands: to stop using binding-arbitration agreements in sexual-harassment cases. As Walker noted, ""Collective action actually works to get change when official channels don't.""24

""The tech workers' movement is here to stay,"" says Will Luckman, an organizer with the Democratic Socialists of America's Tech Action working group. ""The question now is: What are we going to do with it?""25

I met Luckman in a Brooklyn cafe a few days after Amazon announced plans for a new headquarters in Long Island City, Queens. Before long, Tech Action had convened a meeting of more than 40 activists and employees-many from major tech companies-at a community center in Manhattan. ""Raise your hand if you hate Amazon,"" one of the organizers said. When it was Luckman's turn to speak, he posed a number of reasons that New Yorkers should be vigilant about an expanded Amazon presence. He also summarized just how central technology companies have become to perpetuating social and economic inequality, either through worker exploitation, gentrification, regulatory capture, or the development of invasive technologies and surveillance that tend, disproportionately, to hurt people of color.26

That's a lot to digest at once. And for workers organizing against Big Tech-not to mention casual observers and ordinary people who resent Facebook and Amazon-it can be difficult to grasp where the problem begins or ends. If Silicon Valley is responsible for high rents, loss of privacy, institutional racism, and low wages, how can ordinary people confront it?27

Luckman and his colleagues suggested several ways forward, including canvassing neighborhoods and circulating a petition opposing Amazon's anti-union stance. An explosion of activism and protests, from town halls to City Council meetings, followed-all organized by community groups in Queens.28

What these groups didn't expect was to see such quick results: Amazon abruptly cancelled its expansion, citing an insufficiently ""positive"" attitude from ""a number of state and local politicians.""29

Amazon represented a threat to so many people that it made itself a galvanizing target, explained Sasha Wijeyeratne, the executive director of CAAV Organizing Asian Communities: ""The scope of this fight was unprecedented, and winning gives us so much hope."" The campaign thus showcased the potential for intersectional organizing against Big Tech: Amazon's work with ICE enraged immigrant communities, its opposition to unions fired up labor organizers, and the gentrification it would provoke mobilized seniors and low-income residents in Queens.30

It's still unclear exactly why Amazon pulled out, but The New York Timesreported that executives were concerned that the new headquarters was inviting too much scrutiny of its business practices. ""We are changing the relationships between local officials, their communities, and tech giants,"" Luckman told me by phone after Amazon announced its withdrawal. The alliances and momentum they built could be taken further; he was particularly excited about an ongoing union drive at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island. Some workers from that warehouse were active in Queens, too. ""The lesson learned here is that collective action does work against these major tech companies,"" Luckman said. ""A well-organized group of community members can fight back-and win.""31

That victory resonates outside of New York as well. ""People are waking up to the impact tech has on our neighborhoods, cities, and democracy,"" said Maria Noel Fernandez, the director of Silicon Valley Rising, which has been organizing against a proposed Google expansion in San Jose. ""The current system of tech corporations subverting local democracy can't continue.""32

he solidarity driving the new tech workers' movement can obscure some uncomfortable tensions. Engineers making six figures don't just see the world differently from their service-worker counterparts: They're treated differently, too.33

Hoffman, the Uber driver, learned this firsthand back in October. Weeks before the global Google walkout, Hoffman and a group of drivers decided to ramp things up a notch with Uber. Not only were they making a fraction of the money they'd come to expect, but the company's opaque deactivation policies were causing some drivers to lose their jobs with no redress once their ratings on the system dipped. Hoffman said that drivers who didn't speak perfect English felt especially vulnerable; riders would give them low ratings, misinterpreting the driver's weak language skills for rudeness.34

At the same time, the drivers were building a movement. When Hoffman first started organizing, the meetings would sometimes attract fewer than a dozen people. But recently, the Uber drivers began holding digital meetings that people could dial into from the road-and by late 2018, Hoffman told me, the meetings were drawing dozens of new participants each week.35

By October, the organizers planned to go to Uber's headquarters to discuss drivers losing their jobs (the company can ""deactivate"" a driver at will). Hoffman never made it through the door: he got tackled by a security guard and slammed to the ground as he tried to walk into the building. He was holding a petition with some 5,000 signatures asking the company to meet with drivers to hear their complaints.36

""I went into flight-or-fight mode,"" Hoffman recalled. Pinned down under the weight of the security guard, with his shoulders and back ground into the pavement, Hoffman felt ""a lot of adrenaline, so I didn't realize until later how much it hurt."" Months later, he was still working with a physical therapist. (Uber has tried to distance itself from the security guard, emphasizing that he was an independent contractor himself.)37

For veteran organizers, the contrast between how Google handled its walkout and how Uber dealt with the petition wasn't surprising. ""When management see coders, they're more likely to think, 'These are 'our people,'"" explained Jeff Ordower, an organizer for gig workers' rights at Silicon Valley Rising, who was there when Hoffman got tackled. ""When they see drivers, they think, 'Wow-that's scary!'"" This is precisely why there's such an effort in the tech workers' movement to link their fates-or at least build solidarity. It was also the dominant theme at the San Francisco TWC meeting, where the Uber driver sat beside the former Google worker to learn about California employment law. This kind of solidarity has already been tested, with promising results: The battle over Amazon, for example, quickly united lefty white-collar activists with union organizers in New York. But it remains to be seen if it can be sustained and nurtured over the long term, especially in the far less sexy realm of community meetings and contract negotiations.38

""In our perfect world, we'd have Uber drivers working with Uber engineers, fighting together,"" an organizer at the meeting remarked. (There were no Uber engineers in attendance.) One optimistic TWC volunteer ticked off a series of recent collaborations between higher-paid and lower-paid workers: The group flew out organizers to help a Unite Here union drive for Facebook cafeteria workers in Seattle, and they supported a SEIU campaign to unionize security guards at Amazon.39

At Google, Whittaker and her fellow organizers have made the treatment of lower-paid Google contractors a central part of their campaign. In a December 5 statement following the walkout, organizers demanded that Google stop treating those workers-who tend to be from marginalized groups and make up nearly half of Google's workforce-differently than full-time staff. Pointing out Google's $9.2 billion quarterly profit, Whittaker and the other organizers asked that the company put that money to good use, by ending the ""pay and opportunity inequity"" between contractors and full-time staff.40

Google has yet to make any significant concessions on the contractor front. And Whittaker is the first to admit that she and her colleagues are still working out a successful organizing model for the industry. ""In some sense, we're in uncharted territory,"" she says. ""What we are seeing are changes around the margins-and it's not surprising the lowest-hanging demands have been the focus of leadership so far.""41

t's seductive to see tech-worker organizing as a panacea for all that ails Big Tech, from labor abuses to privacy violations. But worker power doesn't necessarily translate into progressive outcomes.42

Indeed, as David A. Banks pointed out in an article for The Baffler last year, the unionized workers at Boeing and Lockheed Martin aren't exactly DSA recruits in waiting; they're part of a union that forms a reliable node in the national-security state. What's more, in the current tight labor market, tech workers may feel emboldened to make demands on their employers, but that momentum could easily wane when the economy cools off and workers become more anxious about losing their jobs.43

Shaikan, the UC Berkeley scholar, cautions that cosmetic fixes could take the place of structural solutions. These aren't necessarily unwelcome: In the past year, Amazon announced a $15 hourly wage for its warehouse workers; Google agreed to change its arbitration agreements; and a group of Facebook contractors-backed by their full-time colleagues-successfully resisted a move to fire them if they didn't consent to a contract with less vacation time and fewer benefits than full-time employees get.44

But just as Starbucks assuages public misgivings about inequities in the international-commodities market by offering a branded version of fair-trade coffee, the tech giants will try to neutralize public opposition with partial gestures toward social justice-for example, more robust diversity programs for high-paid workers. ""You always have to be on the lookout for co-option,"" Shaikan said.45

The activists in the trenches aren't dwelling on hypotheticals just yet. ""We have a strong hand, and the drivers are behind us,"" Hoffman said, noting that although they haven't successfully squeezed any concessions out of Uber, more and more drivers are dialing into the weekly organizing meetings. ""There's a rumbling of defection"" against management in Big Tech, Whittaker told me. ""They're being pushed by a growing group of concerted workers-when it's more costly to stay where they are, they will move in our direction.""46

Back in the Women's Building in San Francisco, momentum was building as well: The Square employees realized that Uber's corporate headquarters is located in their office building. ""Let's stay in touch,"" one of the Square workers remarked to the Uber driver as they walked out. ""Let us know if you need anything.""47",150,Tom Mcenery,5-Mar-19,Opinion: Tech Museum Embodies The Best Of Silicon Valley,689,The East Bay Times (california),,"Opinion: Tech Museum Embodies The Best Of Silicon Valley

HIGHLIGHT:еКWhat began as a dream has inspired boys and girls for the past 20 years

Many gathered at the Tech Museum of Innovation recently to celebrate the 20th anniversary of this iconic edifice.

I was honored to be a speaker with its first president, the trail blazer, Peter Giles, andеК the energetic Tim Ritchie, theеК second and current president. We celebrated and recalled the many phases from concept to dedication. In my comments, I mused that this was the greatest assemblage of creativity and entrepreneurship here since one afternoon when Bob Noyce had coffee with Bill Hewlett - alone.

In his comments, Giles asked me about the promise I had made in my 1983 state of the city in my first weeks as mayor and if I remembered the challenge I issued then.еК With a bow to a famous movie, I recounted the words clearly:

""We will make this museum an offer they can't refuse.""

This magical spot called Silicon Valley did not start here in San Jose and did not evolve here.еК It possibly began in a garage on Addison Avenue in Palo Alto where two young engineering graduates began Hewlett-Packard, that vaunted, principled company. It also began our mythic creation story.

The Tech as it would become known was the idea of visionaries in the Junior League of Palo Alto. I believed with the partnership offer from our city we could forge the link to make it a reality.

It was daunting task.

Etched in its front wall today are the inspirational words of Bill Hewlett, David Packard, Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore. I often stop there now. They are an antidote to cynicism and laxity. This is the company of giants and the best of role models. This wall is our Mount Rushmore.

Moore's quote there has always inspired me and brought a smile at the same time.

It is not his most famous, ""Moore's Law"" on the changing power and cost of the microprocessor but another:

""If everything you try works, you are not trying hard enough.""

I love that quote for it expresses everything worthwhile about our venture, this Valley and indeed America. We tried, failed, then failed better. Then we succeeded.

After years and attempts and corrections, the Tech opened two decades ago on Chavez Plaza. And as the yellow school buses came and came carrying their precious cargo of boys and girls, young men and young women, you clearly see the future.еК One hundred and thirty thousand students arrive each yearеК along with presidents and potentates and tourists. As they are inspired as they in turn inspire us.

The people of San Jose and the dedicated supporters made it happen. The chairs were all remembered that night:еК Tony Ridder, Yvette del Prado, Frank Quattrone, Mike Hackworth, Ned Barnholt, Ann Bowers Noyce, and Chris DiGiorgio. Also Adobe's John Warnock who weaponized technology to aid creativity in writing, publishing and film production was thanked. Jim Morgan of Applied Materials was saluted as the patron of the Tech for Global Good, and its work for the planet. The last speaker was our founding chair, еКEd Zschau, who said something that echoed through the galleries and I'll paraphrase: My dream is that one day after a young woman receives the Nobel Prize for Physics or Medicine that she will thank her family, her teachers and then note that her first inspiration was her time as a girl at the Tech in San Jose that first sparked her interest.

Indeed, Silicon Valley did not start here nor did it have its first successes here.еК But when you see the faces of the young people filled with wonder, the light in their eyes, you know that Silicon Valley at its best lives and breathes here in that Mango Dome on a plaza in Downtown San Jose.

Thirty-six years ago we made them an offer they did not refuse, and when I see those buses and those smiles, I know that it was a worthy one.

The Bay Area and the tech industry have much to learn from Amazon's New York headquarters debacle, which recently ended when the tech giant backed out of the deal to put its second headquarters in Queens.

The main lesson: When it comes to major developments of this nature, it's all about relationships. Especially in an era when housing costs are spinning out of control.

As tech firms continue their expansion plans - including Google's effort to build an urban village that would bring 20,000 jobs to downtown San Jose - it's imperative that communities and tech firms build healthy relationships that carry reasonable expectations, recognize each other's needs and work together to resolve differences. It's hard work that requires patience, communication, compromise and trust, all of which were in short supply in the Long Island negotiations.

Amazon's first mistake was a whopper.

Acting as if you're God's gift to the universe doesn't work well in the dating world. Nor is it a good way to begin a business relationship.

Amazon spent a year shopping for a partner in the most public way possible, promising up to 50,000 new jobs and $5 billion in investments. Hundreds of jobs-hungry cities from across the United States responded, offering billions in giveaways. Amazon eventually decided to split its HQ2 between New York City and suburban Washington, D.C., after New York offered up more than $3 billion in incentives. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo joked that he would change his name to ""Amazon Cuomo"" in order to gain the bid. That didn't sit well with those living in the Queens neighborhoods who would be negatively impacted by the headquarters.

It led to a backlash from local politicians and labor leaders who were more interested in killing the project than finding a way to make it work.

The contrast between the Amazon-New York deal and San Jose's agreement with Google couldn't be sharper.

Google did not seek any incentives for its mega-downtown San Jose project. Nor were any provided by the city. Google is paying full freight for the land and future infrastructure costs.

Google has already agreed to be a full partner in building the city's long-desired transit village in the Diridon Station area. If all continues as planned, the area will be a gathering place for all, with a mixture of retail, entertainment, public spaces and housing that will benefit the entire community. Google has also agreed in principle to a package of community benefits that will include affordable housing.

It's still possible that the relationship could unravel. Nearly 200 protesters jammed City Hall and eight were arrested when the City Council approved the sale of more than $100 million in land to Google in December. Critics fear the project will push vulnerable people out of the city. It will be important that Google and the City Council continue to engage the community as they try to reach agreement on the specifics of what the community benefits package should include.

As with any relationship, expect disagreements. How issues that arise are approached will make all the difference. Amazon and New York City provided a model for how to make a worthy project turn into a full-blown debacle.",152,Fiona Kelliher,1-Mar-19,Google Snaps Up Top Bay Area Real Estate Executive,403,San Francisco Business Times (california),,"Google Snaps Up Top Bay Area Real Estate Executive

A high-profile San Francisco real estate executive has made the switch to Google.

Alexa Arena, general manager for West Coast development at Lendlease, now works for the search engine powerhouse, NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google spokesperson Gina Scigliano confirmed.

She did not respond to further questions about Arena's title or duties, nor whether she has started in her new role. The move comes three years after Arena joined Lendlease to oversee ""development capabilities throughout the California market, pursuing and identifying urban regeneration projects, as well as supporting our development efforts nationally,"" the company said at the time.

Before that, Arena was the top Bay Area executive at developer Forest City. During her 10 years there, she ushered about 6 million square feet of residential, office and retail space through the development pipeline. Arena and Lendlease did not respond to several requests for comment.

""Alexa's extensive experience runs across multiple project types including office, residential, cultural and retail,"" said Denis Hickey, Lendlease's CEO Americas, back when Lendlease hired her in 2015.

Sydney, Australia-based Lendlease focuses on property management and construction, but is also developing a tower at 30 Van Ness in San Francisco from the ground-up. Its notable construction projects include Tishman Speyer's Lumina condo project in San Francisco and the now-stalled Oceanwide Plaza in Los Angeles.

Google's real estate footprint, meanwhile, continues to grow in California and beyond as the company pursues increasingly ambitious projects. The company owns about half of its 20-million-square-foot footprint across the Bay Area, and recently proposed a massive tech campus with up to 8 million square feet of commercial space in San Jose. Google also paid about $2.4 billion for New York's Chelsea Market last year.

Before her real estate career, Arena attended Barnard College and received both a master of business administration and master of public administration at Harvard University, according to her LinkedIn.

Laurie Gustafson, a former head of the professional group Commercial Real Estate Women S.F., previously told the Business Times that Arena is a ""highly regarded leader in Bay Area real estate.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКCity officials say San Jose can boost downtown with taller buildings without hurting airport or air safety, but pilots and others aren't convinced.

CLICK HERE if you are having a problem viewing the photos on a mobile device

San Jose officials put off a vote Tuesday that would allow taller downtown buildings in a bid to boost development amid concerns about aircraft safety and the viability of cross-country and international flight service at the citys airport.

This is still too complex for me to feel comfortable making a decision, Vice Mayor Chappie Jones said at an agenda-setting meeting last week. The decision were going to make is going to impact the city for the next 100 years. I just dont want to have a situation where we dont know what we dont know.

Mayor Sam Liccardo agreed to put off a vote but was frustrated over the delay on an issue the city has been hashing out for a decade and a half.

I think its important for us to move forward, Liccardo said at that meeting. My concern is that deferring and deferring and deferring because some people have questions  which may be very reasonable questions to raise  unfortunately never gets us to the finish line.

Federal Aviation Administration guidelines meant to protect airspace around airports to ensure planes have room to take off and land safely even if they lose power in an engine from, say, striking a bird, have effectively capped the skyline in San Jose. Mineta San Jose International Airport is less than four miles from downtown, where incoming planes fly low enough that passengers heads in the windows can be seen from the street.

The city considered relaxing height restrictions in 2007, but backed off, Liccardo said, because a major airline was opposed. But conversations continued, he said, and since then, that airline and others as well as airport officials have grown comfortable that buildings can be taller without hurting air safety or airport service.

The City Council was set to vote on allowing buildings to be anywhere from 5 to 35 feet taller in the downtown core and anywhere from 70 to 150 feet taller around Diridon Station, San Joses downtown train station. The citys Office of Economic Development argues the new development it would allow would bring millions of dollars more in tax dollars each year and new vibrancy to a city long known for its sprawl.

But the citys 10-member Airport Commission disagrees, arguing taller buildings would require planes in some conditions to carry less fuel, cargo and passengers to fly in and out safely. Longterm, they said that would hurt San Joses ability to attract and keep direct flights to Europe, Asia and the East Coast.

In my opinion, the only winners in this current situation are downtown developers, Airport Commission Chairman Dan Connolly said Tuesday. The airport will suffer from this, and it wouldnt surprise me to see airlines just stop flying routes.

Commissioners were resistant to any change in the height limits, Connolly said, but came up with a compromise that would allow taller buildings around Diridon but not downtown. Google is buying up property near the station for its plans to build a downtown campus for up to 20,000 employees.

Commissioner Raymond Greenlee, a longtime pilot for a major airline who has flown in and out of San Jose, said Tuesday there have been no technological developments in recent years that would alleviate danger from tall buildings in the airport flight path.

It was already an obstacle out there, Greenlee said. It only takes a couple mistakes here and there and all of a sudden you have catastrophe on your hands.

He added that as a professional pilot I do know more than our mayor knows when it comes to this  its a reduction in safety and it hinders the viability of our airport long-term.

An email from a Hawaiian Airlines manager, commissioners said, suggests at least one airline isnt comfortable with the looser height limits the city is proposing. Flight Operations Manager Kalani Sloat said in the Feb. 20 email to Airport Director John Aitken that the proposal city officials are favoring is the second least acceptable and impacts our cargo capacity in every market out of SJC in the summer. He did not respond to a request for comment.

Liccardo said Tuesday, however, that the email is no different from what Hawaiian has been telling our staff all along. He added that airline, airport and FAA officials who have been debating this issue for years have concluded that the very modest reductions in aircraft operations that would result from the relaxed height limits are safe and manageable.

Weve got a lot of very competent people working hard on this, Liccardo said. I think we have to at least recognize they understand how to run their airlines, the FAA understands how to run the FAA and our airport has a pretty good idea how to run the airport.

Everybody is absolutely convinced no flight is going to take off if its unsafe.",154,Thy Vo,22-Feb-19,Liccardo Under Fire Over Previously Undisclosed Downtown Condo Property Near,1252,The East Bay Times (california),,"Liccardo Under Fire Over Previously Undisclosed Downtown Condo Property Near

HIGHLIGHT:еКSan Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo failed to disclose a downtown condominium owned by his wife near a controversial Google development.

SAN JOSE  San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo failed to disclose a downtown condominium owned by his wife near a controversial Google development, raising questions about whether his interest in the property would have disqualified himеКfrom votes related to the project and other decisions he made.

Under California law, public officials are required to disclose their income, financial interests, properties and investments  including the assets belonging to their spouses  to determine potential conflicts of interest in making decisions.

Liccardo's wife, Jessica Kohl-Garcia, owned a downtown condominium about a mile fromеКthe Google development site since 2005, and when they married in May 2013, he didn't reportеКthat ownership on his annual disclosures.

He first reported the property in February 2018, when he also amended previous disclosures dating back to 2014.

At that point, the city was well underway with private negotiations with Google over their downtown development.еКLiccardo had voted to begin public negotiations with the company in June 2017.

City Attorney Rick Doyle said he doesnt believe there is any conflict, noting the distance between the Google development and condominium is about a mile, well over the 500 foot threshold where, under state law, an official is presumed not to have a conflict unless evidence is presented otherwise.

The couple sold the condo for $745,000 in March 2018, according to public records. The city council voted to approve the sale of city-owned property to Google in December 2018, nine months after the condo was sold. Liccardo didnt immediately have information on how much he and his wife profited from that sale.

Liccardo said his failure to disclose the property was a mistake.

""The assumption that they hadеКanything to do with each other is unequivocally false, and would not be a conflict of interestеКunder anyеКcircumstance anyway,"" said Liccardo in an interview Wednesday evening.

Liccardo acknowledged its possible the property created conflicts on other votes he made during that five-year period after their marriage and before they sold the property, but said he is unaware of any specific projects or votes that might be affected.

The mayor maintains his votes on the Google development were entirely legal, but said he has asked the state ethics watchdog, the Fair Political Practices Commission, to clarify potential conflicts involving his wifes condominium.

FPPC spokesman Jay Wierenga confirmed that Liccardo self-reported a possible violation to the agencys enforcement division, but did not have details about what he reported.

Questions about the previously undisclosed property arose after a Feb. 16 story by the nonprofit news website San Jose Spotlight. According to Spotlight, Liccardo amended his 2013 forms the day after their reporter contacted him about the issue

The disclosures, known as form 700s, are made under penalty of perjury but are largely self-policed. The city attorney relies on themеКto advise council members and other public officials about potential legal conflicts that would disqualify them from making decisions.

Asked to explain why he didn't disclose the property after getting married in May 2013, Liccardo said he annually updated the section related to his stocks and investments, and simplyеКdidn't revisit other sections of the form after he got married.

""That's what I did year after year, and after we got married it never dawned on me to look at other parts on the form to think about what other assets I should or should not disclose based on being married to Jessica,"" said Liccardo.

He says he wasn't involved in his wife's management of the condominium, which she rented out, until growing problems with the building's maintenance prompted a conversation about selling the property.

""At that point it dawned on me, if I'm getting more engaged in this and we're thinking of selling, and I might benefit from a sale, this is an asset I really should be disclosing on the form 700,"" Liccardo said.

Liccardo acknowledged he should have disclosed the property immediately, but said the public was not deprived of knowledge of his financial interests.

He noted the city council vote to sell city property to Google occurred after he disclosed the property in February and after he and his wife sold the condominium in March.

""First, the disclosure was made publicly, ten months before the council voted on the sale of the property to Google,"" said Liccardo.

""Secondly, it was never a secret that I own my home in the downtown already, Liccardo said, referring to the home he and his wife now share. and like tens of thousands of property owners, economic development in the vicinity is a good thing.""

Bob Stern, who co-authored the states Political Reform Act which covers conflicts of interest, said ""Clearly he should have disclosed it...the big question is how much [the sale] was affected by the development.

State law requires officials to recuse themselves from decisions within 500 feet of properties that they own or financially benefit from. There are exceptions up to 1,000 feet, but beyond that distance, officials are presumed to have no conflict unless there's clear evidence to the contrary.

There's also an exception that allows an official to vote, when the financial effect of a decision on a public official cannot be distinguished from the effect on the general public.

""Part of it, too, is if everybody's property goes up, then you don't have to disqualify yourself, it's only when your property is fairly close to the development, Stern said.

Doyle said it can be difficult to isolate rising property values to a single project.

""You'd have to see that it was absolutely clear that this specific project, Google or anything else, would affect the value of the property...and that's always difficult given that Silicon Valley properties have gone through the roof,"" said Doyle. ""So do you attribute it to the project or the health of the economy generally?""

Doyle said Liccardo first consulted staff about the condominium property in 2017, around the time he first reported the property on his forms. Doyle said he was otherwise unaware of the condo property until that point and he doesn't believe there is a conflict.

Violations of the Political Reform Act carry a penalty of up to $5,000 per violation, depending on the seriousness of the violation, an individuals history of violations, cooperation with authorities, and other factors, according to Wierenga.

Google's plan to build a new campus by Diridon train station, employing up to 20,000 people, has triggered a sharp jump in prices for commercial real estate in the area, dubbed the ""Google effect"" by developers.

Sandy Perry, an organizer with the Affordable Housing Network of Santa Clara County who has opposed the Google development, said even if the mayor didn't violate the law, he believes Liccardo should not have voted on the project because the condoеКbenefited from a rise in property values.

""There may be some technicalities about the number of yards where it's conflict, so maybe technically he may be off the hook, but it's just not right,"" said Perry.

Liccardo has run afoul of conflict of interest rules in the past. In 2009, Liccardo paid back $461 in tickets to a San Jose Sharks hockey game, after the Mercury News reminded him of a city policy that prohibits officials from accepting sports tickets. The tickets also violated a state limit on individual gifts, which was $390 in 2008.

The failure of Amazon to land a new campus in New York is more than just a reaction to a growing anti-corporate sentiment around the nation. It is more than just a bunch of angry activists successfully putting pressure on their local government to prevent the world's retail giant from opening shop in their community.

The now widely reported collapse of the deal that prevented Amazon with all its lobbying power and influence from establishing another home near the financial capital of the world requires a deeper analysis of both the perception and actions of Amazon itself.

Think about it. Amazon paid zero federal income taxes the last two years while its profits increased from $5.6 billion in 2017 to $11.2 billion in 2018. On top of that, the company reportedly is expected to receive tax cuts worth hundreds of millions of dollars thanks to President Trump's new tax law and over $100 million in tax rebate.

Based on this alone, why should New Yorkers, including those who are economically struggling, be so inclined to quickly approve billions in tax breaks for Amazon to move there without some tough questions? Why should they fund a company that hasn't paid federal taxes in two years to come to their town and promise to bring jobs, some of which will have to be filled by outside talent anyway?

At a time when major corporations and billionaires are facing increasing public scrutiny about the need to seriously address issues of inequality as well as paying their fair share of taxes like everyone else, Amazon's chances in New York were doomed from the beginning.

In fact, the issue of corporations paying more taxes was a topic for discussion at the 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos. Oxfam International, an organization that focuses on global inequality sought to make a link between corporate taxes and inequality.

""Many governments are fueling this inequality crisis. They are under taxing corporations and wealthy individuals yet underfunding vital public services like healthcare and education. These policies hit the poor hardest. The human costs are huge, with women and girls suffering the most,"" the group said.

That is the lens through which New Yorkers who led a crusade against Amazon viewed the deal and killed it. Not paying taxes wasn't music to their ears.

For one of the world's leading companies to not pay federal taxes two years in a row feeds into the existing perception that corporations are always looking for a free ride at taxpayer expense. Even if that is not the practice for all companies, Amazon is now viewed by some of its critics as an example of that kind of culture.

Meanwhile, San Jose didn't offer incentives to Amazon and Google to come to the city, but Google has agreed to build a campus there anyway.

""The lesson for cities really ought to be, don't take the bait. And don't even offer the bait,"" Mayor Sam Liccardo told National Public Radio last week.

Liccardo said in an NPR interview that the city is mandating that 25 percent of the housing that will be built around the Google campus be rent-restrictive and affordable. And Google, according to the San Jose mayor, has agreed to help fund the development.

The lesson for Detroit officials in a city with massive poverty is to ask hard questions regarding similar projects. And for companies in the city, they should take note not to be another Amazon.

I had a conversation this week with a corporate leader in the city about perception versus reality, and how some companies are painted with a broad brush in the wider community as out of touch because of the actions of counterparts in other industries whose work may not be inclusion driven.

In 2019, corporations must project people-centered values that communities they operate in can relate to, not just focused on racking up profits.

HIGHLIGHT:еКA big hurdle for a proposed mixed-use residential and retail development was cleared in early February, when an affiliate controlled by two San Jose-based developers bought a site at the southeast corner of South Market and Balbach streets.

SAN JOSE  A new housing development could sprout in an up-and-coming arts and entertainment district in the southern section of downtown San Jose.

A big hurdle was cleared on Feb. 1, when an affiliate controlled by two San Jose-based developers bought the development site at the southeast corner of South Market and Balbach streets, a short distance from the citys convention center.еКActing through the affiliate, developers John Pringle and Dennis Randall, principal executives of AcquityеКRealty, paid $6.5 million for the property, according to Santa Clara County public records.

There is a lot of demand for residential and we really like this location, Pringle said.

The site is in the South First Area, a downtown San Jose arts, entertainment, restaurant and nightlife district thats nicknamed SoFA.

The developers have proposed construction of 130 residential units and ground-floor retail, and potentially a restaurant.

Being in SoFA totally works with this project, Pringle said. The theaters, the nightlife really play into this. There is a lot of interest in a restaurant on the ground floor.

At present, the project site at 477 S. Market St. is occupied byTate Family Complete Auto Care, whose offerings include Firestone tires.

The name we picked for the project is The Firestone, Pringle said.

Acquity is planning amenities that would go beyond retail offerings. Pringle said The Firestone, planned as five stories, will have rooftop gardens and a barbecue.

The developers are actively seeking construction financing for the project, hope to break ground before mid-year and say the first residences could become available by the end of 2020. To help control building costs, the project will feature wood frames.

The cost of construction is rising faster than rents, Pringle said. He estimated that construction costs have been rising by about 8 percent to 12 percent annually in recent years.еКAn unprecedented building boom in Silicon Valley has intensified demand for construction materials and labor.

The SoFA district is really blossoming, said Mark Ritchie, president of Ritchie Commercial, a real estate firm.

Among the new residential projects in the area: The Pierce, with 230 units, opened recently; and Sparq, with 105 units, is under construction.

Its amazing to see how SoFA is changing with the new residential in the area, Ritchie said.

Downtown San Jose in particular has seen a jump in development proposals, new construction and property purchases, especially since BART is expected to connect to the Diridon train station.еКThe widening interest in downtown San Jose soared after it was revealed that Google was interested in a transit-oriented community of office buildings, homes, restaurants and shops near Diridon Station where 25,000 people could work, including 15,000 to 20,000 employed by the search giant.

Plus, Adobe intends to build a new office tower for 4,000 of its employees next to its existing three-building downtown San Jose headquarters campus.

Google isnt here yet, but millennial urban renters like whats going on in downtown San Jose, Pringle said. You constantly can feel a new vibe and energy downtown.",157,"Elizabeth Dwoskin, Dwoskin Writes For The Washington Post.",19-Feb-19,Google Quietly Got Tax Breaks;,1871,Los Angeles Times,Business; Business Desk; Part C; Pg. 1,"Google Quietly Got Tax Breaks;

Last May, officials in Midlothian, Texas, a city near Dallas, approved more than $10 million in tax breaks for a huge, mysterious new development across from a shuttered Toys R Us warehouse.

That day was the first time officials had spoken publicly about an enigmatic developer's plans to build a sprawling data center. The developer, which incorporated with the state four months earlier, went by the name Sharka. City officials declined at the time to say who was behind Sharka.

The mystery company was Google -- a fact the city revealed two months later, after the project was formally approved.

Larry Barnett, president of Midlothian Economic Development, one of the agencies that negotiated the data center deal, said he knew at the time the tech giant was the one seeking a decade of tax giveaways for the project, but he was prohibited from disclosing it because the company had demanded secrecy.

""I'm confident that had the community known this project was under the direction of Google, people would have spoken out, but we were never given the chance to speak,"" said Travis Smith, managing editor of the Waxahachie Daily Light, the local paper. ""We didn't know that it was Google until after it passed.""

After the deal went through, Sharka changed its main address to that of Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Site work began last fall.

Google -- which has risen to become one of the world's most valuable companies by transforming the public's ability to access information -- has vastly expanded its geographic footprint over the last decade, building more than 15 data centers on three continents and 70 offices worldwide.

But that development spree has often been shrouded in secrecy, making it nearly impossible for some communities to know, let alone protest or debate, who is using their land, their resources and their tax dollars until after the fact, according to Washington Post interviews and newly released public records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

With their growing reach into the U.S. economy and in the face of greater political scrutiny, tech giants including Google and Amazon are on a tear to expand -- but communities now see their arrival more skeptically for the disruption, environmental impact and higher cost of living they often bring, as well as the incentives they seek, despite their deep pockets.

Local officials say they are pressed to maintain secrecy to lure powerful tech companies, which wish to avoid controversies and keep details about their operations under wraps. On Thursday, that ability to play hardball was on full display after Amazon pulled the plug on plans to build a sprawling campus in New York rather than endure further public criticism of the project.

Amazon's yearlong search for a second headquarters was criticized for its use of confidentiality agreements that were so restrictive that officials couldn't comment on their existence, and for playing cities against one another in a quest for government incentives. Some New York lawmakers were so outraged by the secrecy of Amazon's process that they have introduced bills that would ban nondisclosure agreements for development projects in the city and state. (Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post.)

Apple has also sought multimillion-dollar tax giveaways to build a 5,000-person campus in Austin, Texas, its largest facility by number of employees after its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.

Facebook is slated to receive $150 million in property tax incentives for building a 970,000-square-foot data center in Utah, the company and local officials announced last year.

Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai announced $13 billion in new investments in data centers and offices across the U.S., a move that would grow the company's physical footprint to 24 states and create 10,000 construction jobs. He said that 2019 would be the second year in a row the company is growing faster outside its home in the Bay Area than in it.

Yet Google has made extensive use of nondisclosure agreements in negotiations for its planned second campus in San Jose, the largest after its headquarters in nearby Mountain View. It has plans to build a large campus in New York as well as several other development projects, including in Virginia and Nevada, according to public announcements and company statements.

""We believe public dialogue is vital to the process of building new sites and offices, so we actively engage with community members and elected officials in the places we call home,"" Google spokeswoman Katherine Williams said in a statement. ""In a single year, our data centers created $1.3 billion in economic activity, $750 million in labor income, and 11,000 jobs throughout the United States. Of course, when we enter new communities we use common industry practices and work with municipalities to follow their required procedures.""

Amazon declined to comment. Facebook and Apple didn't respond to requests for comment.

Confidentiality agreements are common in development negotiations. But the level of secrecy around data center deals is unusual, experts say.

""Public transparency laws are designed to keep the public interest at the contract table, and the way you do that is with information,"" said Michelle Wilde Anderson, a Stanford Law School professor specializing in state and local government law. ""If you scrutinize the winners and losers in this bargain, you see that Google is overwhelmingly the winner. Google has a strategic interest in getting their name out of these deals so that they go down more quietly, without public debate.""

The Google records were obtained by the advocacy group Partnership for Working Families, which has sued the city of San Jose over its negotiations with Google, arguing that the more than a dozen nondisclosure agreements officials signed were illegal under California law. The Partnership for Working Families, which lobbies against issues such as income inequality, argues that secretive arrangements keep the public in the dark about the costs and benefits of corporate projects.

The records date to 2006, when Google began its first wave of building data centers -- warehouses of servers that house computing infrastructure. The company was racing to fight Microsoft and Yahoo in a war over search and new applications such as Gmail. The documents continue into 2018, offering a rare glimpse into the lengths Google has gone to keep these projects and their impact on the surrounding communities under wraps for over a decade.

Data centers, which can generate significant revenue for communities but use local resources such as energy and water, are sensitive sites for tech companies. If they are attacked, they could wipe out operations for the company. Everything from the technology they use to the location they are in are highly competitive.

The Partnership for Working Families sent Freedom of Information Act requests to local governments involved in brokering deals for Google's eight existing data centers in the U.S., plus Midlothian, and sent seven additional requests to cities where Google has offices.

Officials in eight of the cities signed nondisclosure agreements, or NDAs, in their real estate dealings with Google, according to the documents. The documents also show that the search giant used shell companies to negotiate to build data centers in five of the six localities with data centers that responded to the records requests: Midlothian; Berkeley County, S.C.; Council Bluffs, Iowa; Lenoir, N.C.; and Clarksville, Tenn.

Google's identity was eventually revealed, but often so late in the process that it precluded public debate.

Sometimes Google formed multiple subsidiaries, with distinct names, to handle different aspects of negotiations for the same site, according to the documents. When Google's representatives first approached Midlothian in 2016, they used a code name that was not the same as either of the subsidiaries, Barnett said. (He declined to say what it was.)

Google also asked Midlothian officials to sign a confidentiality agreement before they knew the developer's identity, Barnett said. He said Google revealed its identity a year later, as the deal approached.

Barnett said that some confidentiality is always necessary when negotiating competitive development deals.

""When I'm trying to win a project, as all economic developers do, we abide by what the company wants. It would be detrimental to us to not follow the company's lead,"" he said. ""I've been doing this for 20 years, and my job is to make sure that my city gets the best deal.""

Barnett said he did not believe that residents got the short end of the stick. Google's $500-million development would support local businesses, schools and 40 jobs that Google has promised to create over five years.

The records also demonstrate how Google was able to keep publicly relevant information out of view. Lenoir, where Google announced in 2007 it would build a data center, agreed to treat as a trade secret information about energy and water use, the number of workers to be employed by the data center, and the amount of capital the company would invest, according to the documents.

The Google subsidiary, Tapaha Dynamics, then moved to exempt such trade secrets from transparency laws that allow citizens to make public information requests. At one point, according to the documents, Lenoir's city attorney instructed City Council members not to answer questions about the project during a public hearing.

Williams, the Google spokeswoman, told the Washington Post that it considered information such as water and energy use to be trade secrets because competitors could use it to draw sensitive conclusions about the company's technology.

Google's secret negotiations appeared to lead to favorable land prices for the company. In 2008, Google purchased 850 acres of land for a dollar from Council Bluffs Industrial Foundation, a nonprofit that works with the city of Council Bluffs, according to deeds from the sale.

Smaller cities, in particular, face a sizable power imbalance when they go to negotiate with some of the wealthiest companies in the world, Wilde Anderson said. Some are so cash-strapped that they lack a single full-time lawyer, she said. Breaking the rules could mean getting into a costly lawsuit with an adversary with a seemingly endless budget.

""Google's huge and well-resourced legal team pushes an NDA across the table, and it's just a mismatch of resources,"" she said. ""Like many parts of life, you get what you pay for.""

In Midlothian, Google's subsidiary had the authority to determine which documents would be disclosed, even if the state attorney general said they were subject to transparency law, according to the records.

A July article in the Waxahachie Daily Light announcing Google's role in the new data center elicited hundreds of comments and shares, with many residents complaining about the low number of jobs and the tax incentives.

""So Google comes in and pays no taxes for 10 years, and only brings in 40 jobs hmm sounds like a great idea,"" one local wrote.

Smith, the managing editor of the Daily Light, said, ""I'm not going to say we've been lied to, but we've been strung along.""",158,Cat Zakrzewski,19-Feb-19,The Technology 202: The British Come To Silicon Valley,1976,Washington Post Blogs,,"The Technology 202: The British Come To Silicon Valley

The United Kingdom's digital chief is visiting Silicon Valley this week as he makes a bold call for regulation of the technology industry. His trip will be the companies' chance to weigh in on a host of new proposals from British lawmakers aimed atеКreiningеКin Big Tech,                                    which would have broad implications extending beyond the country's borders.

Jeremy Wright, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, says he is meeting with executives from companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter to tell them they're out of time to self-regulate. The voluntary steps the companies have taken to tackle disinformation haven't been enough, he wrote in an op-ed this weekend as members of the British Parliament unveiled a scathing report that endorsed holding the companies accountable for abusive or harmful content on their platforms.

Wright said industry should want to have input as the U.K. considers new regulation, and he plans to talk to the companies about plans to ensure what lawmakers do isеК""effective.""

""I'm not asking their permission to do it,"" Wright said in an interview with the BBC this weekend.

Wright also said the United Kingdom is well-positioned to ""lead the way"" when it comes to regulating Silicon Valley.еК That should be cause for concern among technology companies, especially after the British report endorsed a series of tough measures to hold them to a higher standard on disinformation, election integrity and privacy.

The aggressive internationalеКcalls to crack downеКon Silicon Valley could also provide a template for other governments. Regulators in the United States and other European countries are escalating oversight of technology giants like Facebook after repeated privacy scandals and Russian interference in the 2016 election highlighted the platforms' vulnerability to foreign influence operations.

The Federal Trade Commission is in early negotiationsеКwith the company over a multibillion-dollar, record-setting fine following a probe into its privacy lapses. Germany's competition watchdog recently restricted the social network's practice of merging data from its main service with data it collects from other services it owns likeеКWhatsApp as well third-party sites.

The 108-page British report offers a number of recommendations, including proposals to empower local election regulators to oversee social-media companies. The lawmakersеКeven endorsed a special tax toеКpay for an independent regulatorеКto scrutinize Silicon Valley and prevent harmful content from spreading online.

In the report, lawmakers said they hoped other European regulators would use the evidence they gathered to probe Facebook for privacy violations. The report specifically mentions that Ireland is the lead authority on Facebook under Europe's wide-ranging privacy rules and that theyеКhoped Helen Dixon, the country's top privacy regulator, would rely on what they uncovered.

Damian Collins, the BritishеКlawmaker who leads the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee in the House of Commons, told my colleague Tony RommеКthere is ""pretty much strong, cross-party supportеКfor this reform.""

Collins compared the approach to the way the U.K. regulates key industries across the pond such asеКlocal broadcasters and major banks. Collins said banks, for example,еКhave a ""responsibility to report suspicious activity,"" like money laundering, to the authorities. ""That responsibility doesn't exist for the tech companies in the same way,"" he said.

Months ago, Collins and his panel convened nine countries as part of an international committee that grilled a top Facebook executive and pledged further oversight of the tech industry. Collins said the plan is for that panel to meet again in May with the goal of lookingеК""more widely at some of these issues affecting technology companies.""

Collins wants lawmakers to ""develop a greater international understanding about the sort of standards we want to see,"" though he noted thatеКany resulting regulations ultimately will ""differ country to country."" But Collins said he believes that two key U.S. lawmakers -- Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee; and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence panel, feel similarly.

Karim Palant, public policy manager for Facebook in the United Kingdom, said the company shares lawmakers'еКconcerns about disinformation and election integrity.

""While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago,"" Palant said in a statement. ""We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.""

BITS: Google has vastly expanded its U.S. footprint, but it's done so rather secretly.еКSomeеКcommunities sometimesеКfind out information about the company's deals with local officials only after the agreements have been struck, The Washington Post's Elizabeth Dwoskin reported. Google has used nondisclosure agreements when discussing real-estate expansions with local authorities - for instance, a planned second campus in San Jose - and has also resorted to shell companies in talks for building data centers.

""Public transparency laws are designed to keep the public interest at the contract table, and the way you do that is with information,"" Michelle Wilde Anderson, a Stanford Law School professor who specializes in state and local government law, told my colleague.

HIGHLIGHT:еКWith their growing reach into the U.S. economy and in the face of greater political scrutiny, tech giants including Google and Amazon are on a tear to expand - but communities now see their arrival more skeptically for the disruption.

By Elizabeth Dwoskin | The Washington Post

Last May, officials in Midlothian, Texas, a city near Dallas, approved more than $10 million in tax breaks for a huge, mysterious new development across from a shuttered Toys R Us warehouse.

That day was the first time officials had spoken publicly about an enigmatic developers plans to build a sprawling data center. The developer, which incorporated with the state four months earlier, went by the name Sharka LLC. City officials declined at the time to say who was behind Sharka.

The mystery company was Google - a fact the city revealed two months later, after the project was formally approved. Larry Barnett, president of Midlothian Economic Development, one of the agencies that negotiated the data center deal, said he knew at the time the tech giant was the one seeking a decade of tax giveaways for the project, but he was prohibited from disclosing it because the company had demanded secrecy.

Google - which has risen to become one of the worlds most valuable companies by transforming the publics ability to access information - has vastly expanded its geographic footprint over the last decade, building more than 15 data centers on three continents and 70 offices worldwide. But that development spree has often been shrouded in secrecy, making it nearly impossible for some communities to know, let alone protest or debate, who is using their land, their resources and their tax dollars until after the fact, according to Washington Post interviews and newly released public records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

With their growing reach into the U.S. economy and in the face of greater political scrutiny, tech giants including Google and Amazon are on a tear to expand - but communities now see their arrival more skeptically for the disruption, environmental impact and higher cost of living they often bring, as well as the incentives they seek, despite their deep pockets.

Local officials say they are pressed to maintain secrecy to lure powerful tech companies, who wish to avoid controversies and keep details about their operations under wraps. On Thursday that ability to play hardball was on full display after Amazon pulled the plug on plans to build a sprawling new campus in New York City rather than endure further public criticism of the project.

Amazons year-long search for a second headquarters was criticized for its use of confidentiality agreements that were so restrictive that officials couldnt comment on their existence, and for playing cities against one another in a quest for government incentives. : Even after pulling out of New York, the Seattle-based company is slated to take in hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks when it builds its second headquarters in northern Virginia. (Jeff Bezos, the co-founder of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Some New York lawmakers were so outraged by the secrecy of Amazons process that they have introduced bills that would ban nondisclosure agreements for development projects in the city and state.

Apple has also sought multimillion-dollar tax giveaways to build a 5,000-person campus in Austin, Texas, its largest facility by number of employees after its headquarters in Cupertino, California. Facebook is slated to receive $150 million in property tax incentives for building a 970,000-square-foot data center in Utah, the company and local officials announced last year.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced $13 billion in new investments in data centers and offices across the U.S., a move that would grow the companys physical footprint to 24 states and create 10,000 new construction jobs. He said that 2019 would be the second year in the row the company is growing faster outside its home in the Bay Area than in it.

Yet Google has made extensive use of nondisclosure agreements in negotiations for its planned second campus in San Jose, California, the largest after its headquarters in nearby Mountain View. It has plans to build a large new campus in New York City as well as several other development projects, including in Virginia and Nevada, according to public announcements and company statements.

We believe public dialogue is vital to the process of building new sites and offices, so we actively engage with community members and elected officials in the places we call home, Google spokeswoman Katherine Williams said in a statement. In a single year, our data centers created $1.3 billion in economic activity, $750 million in labor income, and 11,000 jobs throughout the United States. Of course, when we enter new communities we use common industry practices and work with municipalities to follow their required procedures.

Amazon declined to comment. Facebook and Apple didnt respond to requests for comment.

Confidentiality agreements are common in development negotiations - but the level of secrecy around data center deals is unusual, experts say.

The Google records were obtained by the advocacy group Partnership for Working Families, which has sued the city of San Jose over its negotiations with Google, arguing that the more than a dozen non-disclosure agreements officials signed with the search were illegal under California law. Partnership for Working Families, which lobbies against issues such as income inequality, argues that secretive arrangements keep the public in the dark about the costs and benefits of corporate projects.

The records date back to 2006, when Google began its first wave of data center construction - warehouses of servers that house computing infrastructure - as the company raced to fight Microsoft and Yahoo in a war over search and new applications such as Gmail. The documents continue into 2018, offering a rare glimpse into the lengths Google has gone to keep these projects and their impact on the surrounding communities under wraps for over a decade.

If they are attacked, they could wipe out operations for the company. Everything from the technology they use to the location they are in are highly competitive.

[Read the documents for Google in Palo Alto, Calif.]

The Partnership for Working Families sent Freedom of Information requests to local governments involved in brokering deals for Googles eight existing data centers in the U.S., plus Midlothian, and sent seven additional requests to cities where Google has offices.

Officials in eight of the cities signed nondisclosure agreements, or NDAs, in their real estate dealings with Google, according to the documents. The documents also show that the search giant used shell companies to negotiate to build data centers in five of the six localities with data centers that responded to the records requests, including Midlothian; Berkeley County, South Carolina; Council Bluffs, Iowa; Lenoir, North Carolina; and Clarksville, Tennessee. Googles identity was eventually revealed, but often so late in the process that it precluded public debate.

Sometimes Google formed multiple subsidiaries, with distinct names, to handle different aspects of negotiations for the same site, according to the documents. In Midlothian, for example, Google created Sharka to negotiate the tax-abatement and the site plans, and used a separate Delaware company, Jet Stream LLC, to negotiate the land purchase with a private owner. In Iowa, Google created Delaware-based Questa LLC for the land sale and Gable Corp. for the development deal.

When Googles representatives first approached Midlothian in 2016, they used a code name that was not the same as either of the subsidiaries, Barnett said. (He declined to say what it was.) Google also asked Midlothian officials to sign a confidentiality agreement before they knew the developers identity, Barnett said. He said Google revealed its identity a year later, as the deal approached.

Barnett said that some confidentiality is always necessary when negotiating competitive development deals. When Im trying to win a project, as all economic developers do, we abide by what the company wants. It would be detrimental to us to not to follow the companys lead, he said. Ive been doing this for 20 years, and my job is to make sure that my city gets the best deal. When a company asks for secrecy, I say yes. You have to build up trust.

Barnett said he did not believe that residents got the short end of the stick. Googles $500 million development would support local businesses, schools and 40 jobs that Google has promised to create over five years. The community wins with this agreement, he said.

The records also demonstrate how Google was able to keep publicly relevant information out of view. Lenoir, North Carolina, where Google announced in 2007 it would build a data center, agreed to treat as a trade secret information about energy and water use, the number of workers to be employed by the data center, and the amount of capital the company would invest, according to the documents. The Google subsidiary, Tapaha Dynamics LLC, then moved to exempt such trade secrets from transparency laws that allow citizens to make public information requests. At one point, according to the documents, Lenoirs city attorney instructed city council members not to answer questions about the project during a public hearing.

Williams, the Google spokeswoman, told The Post that it considers information such as water and energy usage to be trade secrets because competitors could use it to draw sensitive conclusions about the companys technology.

Wilde Anderson said that Googles nondisclosure agreements, which she said are more stringent than other companies, appeared one-sided, protecting Googles interests above those of the city or the public. Midlothians Barnett said it was written so broadly that he feared even disclosing the existence of an agreement would violate the NDA, echoing similar statements from officials in other locations.

Smaller cities, in particular, face a sizable power imbalance when they go to negotiate with some of the wealthiest companies in the world, Wilde Anderson added. Some are so cash-strapped that they lack a single full-time lawyer, she said. Breaking the rules could mean getting into a costly lawsuit with an adversary with a seemingly endless budget.

Googles huge and well-resourced legal team pushes an NDA across the table, and its just a mismatch of resources, she said. Like many parts of life, you get what you pay for.

In Midlothian, Googles subsidiary had the authority to determine which documents would be disclosed, even if the state attorney general said they were subject to transparency law, according to the records.

Googles secret negotiations also appeared to lead to favorable land prices for the company. In 2008, Google purchased 850 acres of land for a dollar from Council Bluffs Industrial Foundation, a nonprofit that works with the city of Council Bluffs, according to deeds from the sale.

Strung along

In a few cases, Googles secretive moves have prompted a public outcry.

Last year, an unfamiliar company filed a water permit application in South Carolina that would have made it the third largest aquifer user in the area, said Emily Cedzo, air, water, and public health projects director with the Coastal Conservation League, an environmental advocacy group in the Carolinas, who spotted the application.

She discovered via a quick Google search that Maguro Enterprises, the company that applied for the permit, shared an address with the Google data center that had been built a few years earlier in Berkeley County, South Carolina.

After her group publicized Googles permit application, the agency was flooded with so many public comments that it led to a heated hearing. Dozens of county residents, and even the manager of the local utility, protested the application because they felt it could become a threat to the communitys drinking supply. No one seemed to know how much water Googles Maguro, which had negotiated a nondisclosure agreement with the countys sanitation department, had been using in the first place, Cedzo said.

I can imagine that people were initially excited that Google would want to call the county home, Cedzo said. But when you start digging a little deeper, it looks different.

Today, Googles Maguro entity is the only company in the countys top 10 users of water whose current volume of use is not publicly disclosed. Its application for more water is stalled, and it runs using the water it was previously allotted.

LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO:                 It was rolled out like a rose ceremony. Who would be chosen to marry Amazon? Every city tried to make themselves the most attractive.

As we know, it didn't quite work out as planned. Activists and local politicians in New York were not happy about offering big tax breaks to Amazon, and Amazon has pulled out of that deal.

As big companies continue to expand, one city in California says it's trying to do things differently. They're asking not what we can do for big tech, but what can tech do for us? NPR's Jasmine Garsd reports from San Jose.

JASMINE GARSD:                 A few years ago, Joseph Chavez's (ph) parents had to do like so many people in San Jose - leave.

JOSEPH CHAVEZ:                 The prices are so outrageous, we've got to move to the Central Valley to actually have affordable homes.

JASMINE GARSD:                 Joseph stayed behind, but he says that like in most of the Bay Area, the cost of living in San Jose has skyrocketed, although it's still not as bad as San Francisco. People who live in San Jose tend to commute to other cities for work. Here's Mayor Sam Liccardo.

SAM LICCARDO:                 We're the only major city in the United States that actually has a smaller daytime population than nighttime population. And as a result, our residents spend a lot of time commuting. We're right up there with the worst cities in commutes. And, obviously, it drives up the housing costs. And so we get the worst of both worlds.

JASMINE GARSD:                 Mayor Liccardo would like that to change. In 2017, when Amazon started looking for a city to house its second headquarters, San Jose threw its hat in the ring. Around the country, it became a circus. Cities did everything they could to lure Amazon. Many offered juicy incentives. Chicago even got William Shatner to narrate a proposal. But San Jose made a point of offering no subsidies.

SAM LICCARDO:                 If you're offering incentives, those are dollars you could use to be building out transit, to be helping supporting an ecosystem of talent development.

JASMINE GARSD:                 This is exactly what many activists argued when Amazon ultimately picked New York for one of its second headquarters. Why does one of the wealthiest companies in the world get these tax breaks and incentives? It caused such a local outrage, last week, Amazon announced it was pulling out.

SAM LICCARDO:                 The lesson for cities really ought to be don't take the bait. And don't even offer the bait.

JASMINE GARSD:                 Liccardo has also been talking to another tech giant, Google, which is headquartered in a town nearby. It wanted to build a campus in San Jose. Again, Liccardo says he offered no incentives. Rather, he says his government asked that 25 percent of the housing built around the campus be affordable. He says this will bring tens of thousands of jobs to the area.

SAM LICCARDO:                 And they've also agreed that we can impose a fee on development in that area and throughout the downtown that will generate dollars we need for affordable housing.

JASMINE GARSD:                 Google is planning to develop as much as 8 million square feet in downtown San Jose. Walking through the area, it lacks the allure of San Francisco or neighboring Palo Alto. It's not hard to see why some are so excited to develop it.

But, here in the Bay Area, that word, development, touches a raw nerve. Will development actually mean affordable housing? And all those shiny tech jobs that keep getting promised - how many actually will go to the locals? Jeff Buchanan is a policy director at Working Partnerships USA, a community labor coalition.

JEFF BUCHANAN:                 So when you look at Google's workforce, only about 7 percent are either Latino or African-American. You look at the population of San Jose, and it just looks incredibly different than who it is that Google's actually hiring. Even if you're a student that graduates from San Jose State University, it ranks nowhere in the top 10 of the universities where Google recruits from.

And so I think when we've gone around and talked with people in the community, they don't think their kids are going to be able to work on the Google campus.

JASMINE GARSD:                 Buchanan says, don't be fooled. The land that San Jose sold to Google could've been used for public works to serve the community.

JEFF BUCHANAN:                 Maybe we're not offering billions in tax rebates, but we're offering really valuable public land in an area where land prices are going through the roof.

JASMINE GARSD:                 Affordable housing is on everyone's mind out here. But Joseph Chavez, the man whose family had to leave San Jose because they just couldn't afford it anymore, says he's hopeful about all those new jobs Google will bring in. Chavez is in construction. He says he's worked on other Google buildings in the past. Maybe he'll get to work on the San Jose site.

JOSEPH CHAVEZ:                 More jobs means more opportunities. More opportunity means everybody gets to eat. If it pays well, you might be able to make it.

JASMINE GARSD:                 Whether or not he'll be able to make it here after Google gets built - that is an open question.

AMAZON'S EXIT FALLOUT

B OAK The Associated Press

JOSH

NEW YORK - Amazon jilted New York City on Valentine's Day, scrapping plans to build a massive headquarters campus in Queens amid fierce opposition from politicians angry about nearly $3 billion in tax breaks and the company's anti-union stance.

With millions of jobs and a bustling economy, New York can withstand the blow, but experts say the decision by the e-commerce giant to walk away and take with it 25,000 promised jobs could scare off other companies considering moving to or expanding in the city, which wants to be seen as the Silicon Valley of the East Coast.

""One of the real risks here is the message we send to companies that want to come to New York and expand to New York,"" said Julie Samuels, the executive director of industry group Tech: NYC. ""We're really playing with fire right now.""

In November, Amazon selected New York City and Crystal City, Virginia, as the winners of a secretive, yearlong process in which more than 230 North American cities bid to become the home of the Seattle-based company's second headquarters.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo heralded the city's selection at the time as the biggest boon yet to its burgeoning tech economy and underscored that the deal would generate billions of dollars for improving transit, schools and housing.

Opposition came swiftly though, as details started to emerge.

Critics complained about public subsidies that were offered to Amazon and chafed at some of the conditions of the deal, such as the company's demand for access to a helipad. Some pleaded for the deal to be renegotiated or scrapped altogether.

BOTCHED FROM THE START

""We knew this was going south from the moment it was announced,"" said Thomas Stringer, a site selection adviser for big companies. ""If this was done right, all the elected officials would have been out there touting how great it was. When you didn't see that happen, you knew something was wrong.""

Stringer, a managing director of the consulting firm BDO USA LLP, said city and state officials need to rethink the secrecy with which they approached the negotiations. Community leaders and potential critics were kept in the dark, only to be blindsided when details became public.

""It's time to hit the reset button and say, 'What did we do wrong?'"" Stringer said. ""This is fumbling at the 1-yard line.""

Amazon said in a statement Thursday that its commitment to New York City required ""positive, collaborative relationships"" with state and local officials and that a number of them had ""made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward.""

Not that Amazon is blameless, experts say.

Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program, said the company's high-profile bidding process may have stoked the backlash. Companies usually search for new locations quietly, in part to avoid the kind of opposition Amazon received.

""They had this huge competition, and the media covered it really aggressively, and a bunch of cities responded,"" Parilla said. ""What did you expect? It gave the opposition a much bigger platform.""

Richard Florida, an urban studies professor and critic of Amazon's initial search process, said the company should have expected to feel the heat when it selected New York, a city known for its neighborhood activism.

""At the end of the day, this is going to hurt Amazon,"" said Florida, head of the University of Toronto's Martin Prosperity Institute. ""This is going to embolden people who don't like corporate welfare across the country.""

Other tech companies have been keeping New York City's tech economy churning without making much of a fuss.

Google is spending $2.4 billion to build up its Manhattan campus. Cloudcomputing company Salesforce has plastered its name on Verizon's former headquarters in midtown, and music streaming service Spotify is gobbling up space at the World Trade Center complex.

Despite higher costs, New York City remains attractive to tech companies because of its vast, diverse talent pool, world-class educational and cultural institutions and access to other industries, such as Wall Street capital and Madison Avenue ad dollars.

No other metropolitan area in the U.S. has as many computer-related jobs as New York City, which has 225,600, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Washington, Boston, Atlanta and Dallas each have a greater concentration of their workers in tech.

In the New York area, the average computer-related job pays roughly $104,000 a year, about $15,000 above the national average. Still, that's about $20,000 less than in San Francisco.

Even after cancelling its headquarters project, Amazon still has 5,000 employees in New York City, not counting Whole Foods.

""New York has actually done a really great job of growing and supporting its tech ecosystem, and I'm confident that will continue,"" Samuels said. ""Today we took a step back, but I would not but the nail in the coffin of tech in New York City.""",162,Michael R.

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe new WeWork office in River Park Tower, perched on the banks of the banks of the Guadalupe River, means WeWork now has 2,700 downtown San Jose members -- employees of companies that sublease co-working spaces in offices that WeWork has leased.

SAN JOSE - WeWork on Friday unveiled a new set of offices in downtown San Jose's River Park Towers complex, using the event to announce that the office is the first California site of the co-working company's endeavor to offer discount rates for startups and fledgling entrepreneurs.

This new office in River Park Tower, perched on the banks of the Guadalupe River, means WeWork now has 2,700 downtown San Jose members - employees of companies that sublease co-working spaces from WeWork.

""We have opened two locations in San Jose, and we are looking to double again in size here,"" said Elton Kwok, general manager, Northern California for WeWork. Besides the River Park Tower operation at 333 W. San Carlos St., WeWork also has leased a location at 75 E. Santa Clara St., both in downtown San Jose.

While not formally open, 152 N. Third St. is slated to be a third location for WeWork, according to the co-working company's website. WeWork now is eyeing a fourth location it hopes to open by year's end.

""We are looking for a location right now,"" Kwok said.

The West San Carlos Street site also is home to an emerging WeWork concept: WeWork Labs has space on the fifth floor where it will offer discounts of 10 percent to startups and new entrepreneurs whose enterprises show promise.

Akin to the quest for affordable housing, the idea here is the affordable office.

""With WeWork Labs, we want to provide local entrepreneurs with resources so they can grow and succeed,"" said Bailey Dodds, expansion manager North America for WeWork. ""Our goal is to provide resources for startups, for high-growth new companies.""

Tech titans such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon, through combinations of property purchases and building leases, have gobbled up a vast amount of space in Silicon Valley and nearby areas such as San Francisco.

Yet this unprecedented hunt for expansion spaces has also consumed the supply of offices - and driven up rental costs - at sites that small companies are seeking for their own operations.

""The big guys are squeezing the little guys out. We love those jobs, but we need a Valley for all,"" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said during the WeWork event. ""One solution is to provide greater access for all.""

Cases in point: Just around the corner from the new WeWork offices, Adobe intends a vast expansion of its three-building headquarters campus by constructing an adjacent fourth office tower where the tech giant would employ 4,000. A few blocks to the west, Google has proposed a transit village of office buildings, homes, shops and restaurants where 25,000 could work, including 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giant's employees.

""So many companies have found their way to San Jose,"" City Councilman Johnny Khamis said.

At present, WeWork has slightly more than 1,500 members working at its first downtown San Jose location at 75 E. Santa Clara St. and another 1,200 at 333 W. San Carlos St., according to Kwok.

In downtown San Jose, WeWork also has ownership stakes in the Bank of Italy building at 8 S. First St., public records show, and is involved with the efforts to develop the Museum Place office and retail complex on Park Avenue.

Roughly 80 percent of the businesses in San Jose are ""micro businesses"" with about 20 employees, as Matt Mahood, president ofеКThe Silicon Valley Organization, put it.

""Small and medium-sized businesses need places to thrive in San Jose,"" Mahood said.",165,Staff & Wire Reports,15-Feb-19,Amazon Jilts Nyc;,3371,The Sunbury News (oh),Opinion,"Amazon Jilts Nyc;

Liberal Dems laud Amazon win, moderates fret leftward drift?

By LISA MASCARO and STEVE PEOPLES

Associated Press

Friday, February 15

WASHINGTON (AP)  What is happening to the Democrats?

Captivated by a handful of liberal superstars, they are venturing where the party has long feared to tread: Steep taxes on the rich. Abolishing an immigration enforcement agency. Proposing ""economic transformation"" to combat climate change. Gleefully waving goodbye to a big business  and its jobs.

On Thursday, newly-elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez led a chorus of cheers as Amazon announced it was abandoning plans to build a sought-after headquarters in New York City. Activists berated the online giant for a $3 billion package of tax breaks she said the city could better invest in hiring teachers or fixing the subway.

This is not the Democratic Party of yesteryear. Or even last year.

""The Amazon New York fight is an illustration of how power is moving to the left,"" said Ben Wikler, of the liberal group MoveOn. ""One of the world's most powerful organizations doesn't want to pick a fight with progressive activists.""

As the liberal flank celebrates its sudden ascendance in the party, energized by the new House freshmen pushing the party toward bold policy solutions, others wonder if the Democrats are veering so far left they're about to fall off a cliff.

It's a valid question ahead of a presidential primary season with an unusually robust roster of contenders trying to wrest the White House from President Donald Trump. The race comes at a time of shifting party loyalties and eroding confidence in traditional corridors of power, a dynamic that has recast the policy prescriptions of both parties.

The big questions for 2020: Will Democrats move beyond the center-left policies that have dominated the party since Bill Clinton's presidency? And if so, will they find the electorate is repelled, as Republicans claim, or will they discover that a country long described as ""center-right"" is receptive to a return to liberalism?

Democratic pollster John Anzalone said the leftward lurch that's playing out in the Amazon fight wouldn't necessarily hurt the party heading into 2020 and could resonate with voters.

""When you're doing corporate giveaways, whether for a big company or a sports team, it's not as cut-and-dry as most people think,"" Anzalone said. ""The fact is there tends to be a belief that these big corporations have a lot of money and use their power to get deals they don't need.""

As if to highlight the churn within the party, the 2020 class was mixed in their reactions.

A spokesman for former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg didn't respond to a request for comment. Howard Schultz, another business-minded former Democrat who's now weighing an independent bid for president, also declined to comment.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who have long railed against the influence of corporations, weighed in, as did New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.

""The people of New York and America are increasingly concerned about the power of large multinational corporations and the billions in corporate welfare they receive,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""Our job is to end the race to the bottom where taxpayers in one city or state are forced to bid against each other for desperately needed jobs. This is what the rigged economy is all about.""

Warren tweeted: ""One of the wealthiest companies on the planet - just walked away from billions in taxpayer bribes, all because some elected officials in New York aren't sucking up to them enough. How long will we allow giant corporations to hold our democracy hostage?""

And Gillibrand said, ""Walking away so quickly shows that Amazon was interested in the taxpayer assistance and not being a good neighbor in Queens hiring the greatest workers in the world.""

As liberal activists across the country welcomed Amazon's decision as a fresh demonstration of the increasing power of the Democratic Party's far-left wing, Republicans highlighted the same thing, using the situation to cast the modern-day Democratic Party as extreme. Following Trump's lead, they pepper their speeches with claims that Democrats are veering toward socialism.

""Now, thousands of #New Yorkers will be deprived of good paying jobs at #amazon because of socialists like AOC - and unfortunately the promise of a #greenjob won't pay the bills,"" former Trump aide Sean Spicer said on Twitter.

On Capitol Hill, it's hard not to compare the arrival of Ocasio-Cortez and the emerging Democratic divide to the tea party class of 2010 that took control of the House and pushed the Republican agenda rightward, ultimately helping give rise to the politics of Trump.

It's not just Ocasio-Cortez. She and House colleagues  Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts jointly announced their opposition to the bipartisan border security deal. They want to cut the Department of Homeland Security's budget over the administration's deportation policies, including those that separated families at the border.

The four lawmakers were urged on by activists outside the Capitol, protesting what's seen as ICE's unnecessarily harsh deportations and raids against immigrants here illegally.

Omar, who is Muslim-American, pushed the party further into conflict this week with comments about Israel that were widely seen as anti-Semitic. She apologized. But the questions she and others are raising about the longstanding U.S. ally reflect a growing unease among some Democrats with Israel's treatment of Palestinians.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the Democratic Party's diversity in the House is its strength, as evidenced by the way her caucus held unified against Trump's demand for money from Congress to build the wall on the border with Mexico.

""Welcome to the Democratic Party,"" Pelosi said Thursday. ""We are not a monolith, never have been. And who would want to lead a party that would be described that way?""

While some high-profile newcomers are capturing media attention, the House majority was also won with new lawmakers who are more measured in their approach to governing even as they battle Trump. All but 19 Democrats approved the bipartisan border package late Thursday.

But other Democrats marvel at how quickly the party has shifted even since the 2016 election.

This week, when the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, announced an upcoming vote on the Green New Deal climate change plan as a way to force Democrats into an awkward vote, the Democrats responded, ""Bring it on."" They say Americans want answers on climate change, and Republicans have none.

Ocasio-Cortez, who stunned Washington when she knocked off an incumbent party leader during a primary last year, recently suggested a 70 percent marginal tax rate on top earners.

""Anything is possible,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Thursday, ""today was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers & their neighbors defeated Amazon's corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world.""

Amazon's exit could scare off tech companies from New York

By MICHAEL R. SISAK and JOSH BOAK

Associated Press

Friday, February 15

NEW YORK (AP)  Amazon jilted New York City on Valentine's Day, scrapping plans to build a massive headquarters campus in Queens amid fierce opposition from politicians angry about nearly $3 billion in tax breaks and the company's anti-union stance.

With millions of jobs and a bustling economy, New York can withstand the blow, but experts say the decision by the e-commerce giant to walk away and take with it 25,000 promised jobs could scare off other companies considering moving to or expanding in the city, which wants to be seen as the Silicon Valley of the East Coast.

""One of the real risks here is the message we send to companies that want to come to New York and expand to New York,"" said Julie Samuels, the executive director of industry group Tech: NYC. ""We're really playing with fire right now.""

In November, Amazon selected New York City and Crystal City, Virginia, as the winners of a secretive, yearlong process in which more than 230 North American cities bid to become the home of the Seattle-based company's second headquarters.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo heralded the city's selection at the time as the biggest boon yet to its burgeoning tech economy and underscored that the deal would generate billions of dollars for improving transit, schools and housing.

Opposition came swiftly though, as details started to emerge.

Critics complained about public subsidies that were offered to Amazon and chafed at some of the conditions of the deal, such as the company's demand for access to a helipad. Some pleaded for the deal to be renegotiated or scrapped altogether.

""We knew this was going south from the moment it was announced,"" said Thomas Stringer, a site selection adviser for big companies. ""If this was done right, all the elected officials would have been out there touting how great it was. When you didn't see that happen, you knew something was wrong.""

Stringer, a managing director of the consulting firm BDO USA LLP, said city and state officials need to rethink the secrecy with which they approached the negotiations. Community leaders and potential critics were kept in the dark, only to be blindsided when details became public.

""It's time to hit the reset button and say, 'What did we do wrong?'"" Stringer said. ""This is fumbling at the 1-yard line.""

Amazon said in a statement Thursday that its commitment to New York City required ""positive, collaborative relationships"" with state and local officials and that a number of them had ""made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward.""

Not that Amazon is blameless, experts say.

Joe Parilla, a fellow at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program, said the company's high-profile bidding process may have stoked the backlash. Companies usually search for new locations quietly, in part to avoid the kind of opposition Amazon received.

""They had this huge competition, and the media covered it really aggressively, and a bunch of cities responded,"" Parilla said. ""What did you expect? It gave the opposition a much bigger platform.""

Richard Florida, an urban studies professor and critic of Amazon's initial search process, said the company should have expected to feel the heat when it selected New York, a city known for its neighborhood activism.

""At the end of the day, this is going to hurt Amazon,"" said Florida, head of the University of Toronto's Martin Prosperity Institute. ""This is going to embolden people who don't like corporate welfare across the country.""

Other tech companies have been keeping New York City's tech economy churning without making much of a fuss.

Google is spending $2.4 billion to build up its Manhattan campus. Cloud-computing company Salesforce has plastered its name on Verizon's former headquarters in midtown, and music streaming service Spotify is gobbling up space at the World Trade Center complex.

Despite higher costs, New York City remains attractive to tech companies because of its vast, diverse talent pool, world-class educational and cultural institutions and access to other industries, such as Wall Street capital and Madison Avenue ad dollars.

No other metropolitan area in the U.S. has as many computer-related jobs as New York City, which has 225,600, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Washington, Boston, Atlanta and Dallas each have a greater concentration of their workers in tech.

In the New York area, the average computer-related job pays roughly $104,000 a year, about $15,000 above the national average. Still, that's about $20,000 less than in San Francisco.

Even after cancelling its headquarters project, Amazon still has 5,000 employees in New York City, not counting Whole Foods.

""New York has actually done a really great job of growing and supporting its tech ecosystem, and I'm confident that will continue,"" Samuels said. ""Today we took a step back, but I would not but the nail in the coffin of tech in New York City.""

Amazon HQ2: Texas experience shows why New Yorkers were right to be skeptical

New York offered Amazon close to US$3 billion to build a ""second"" headquarters in Long Island City on the promise of 25,000 jobs.

Since the deal was joyfully announced in November, however, many local residents and some politicians in the area have been questioning whether it's worth it, both in terms of the price tag and the impact on housing and traffic congestion. And on Feb. 14, Amazon backed out of the deal, citing political opposition to its plans.

The research supports those who question the wisdom of cities and states incentivizing economic development. Studies suggest the jobs and economic gains are usually not worth the tax breaks since the majority of companies would have come even without incentives.

And that's when the companies try to live up to the promises they made. They don't always do so, with the latest example being Foxconn's announcement that it is reconsidering plans to build a factory in Wisconsin - less than a year after agreeing to create up to 13,000 high-tech jobs in exchange for more than $4.5 billion in incentives.

But how often do companies that agree to build factories and create jobs in exchange for economic incentives back away from their promises? And when they do, do taxpayers ever learn about it?

To shine light on these questions, we conducted a study of a Texas economic development program. Taxpayers in any American city considering luring a company with cash should take heed.

Something to hide?

The Texas Enterprise Fund, which started in 2003, allows the state to offer cash grants to companies in exchange for promises of investments and job creation. As of Jan. 1, the program had provided over $600 million in cash incentives to companies vowing to create over 94,000 direct jobs in Texas.

In our study, we submitted public records requests for company applications and agreements for grants. We wanted to see what companies had promised the state in return for the cash.

Our research led to two troubling findings. First, public record law in Texas allows companies themselves to legally challenge requests - which is controversial yet not uncommon among other states.

In our study, 42 out of the 165 recipient companies submitted legal challenges to our requests. Before even seeing the data, we were asking ourselves: What are these companies trying to hide?

Although companies were partially successful in limiting our requests, primarily in getting certain parts of their proposals redacted, the governor's office ultimately provided us with a complete list of companies that had some amendment to their contracts.

To our surprise, over a quarter of companies in the program - or 46 - had renegotiated their incentive deals with the state. These deals weren't announced by the governor's office nor were they reported anywhere online.

Our public records request is still unfolding and we still haven't received the contracts for roughly two-thirds of these companies. For the 63 companies whose contracts we received, 29 had amendments to the original.

SpaceX and Comerica

Most of these amended contracts were designed to reduce companies' commitments to job creation. Two cases in point are SpaceX and Comerica.

SpaceX - a company that designs, manufactures and operates commercial spacecraft - received a $2.3 million grant in 2013 in exchange for a commitment to create 300 jobs at a new launch facility near Brownsville, Texas. In 2017, however, the company secretly renegotiated its grant contract to halve the size of the deal: SpaceX would reduce its commitment to 150 new jobs in return for a grant of $1.15 million. The situation is still a mystery, however, because the fund hasn't paid any funds nor has SpaceX reported jobs as part of the program.

Comerica received $3.5 million in 2007 in exchange for its commitment to create 200 jobs as part of its plan to move its headquarters to Dallas from Detroit. In 2012, the financial services giant amended the contract to allow 15 of its current executives - including the CEO - to be counted towards the job and wage target as long they relocated to Texas.

In case after case, companies renegotiated grant contracts in similar ways to get a better deal, all while avoiding public scrutiny. In contrast, announcements of the original agreements were typically covered as big events and photo ops, such as when former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and SpaceX founder Elon Musk broke ground together.

Empty promises

Perhaps most disturbingly, our two findings - company challenges and renegotiations - were related.

We found that companies that had renegotiated their contracts were much more likely to have challenged our public records request, at almost double the rate.

This pattern is consistent with companies using public records laws to hide their non-compliance with their job creation promises.

The finding, even if limited to a single state, is troubling. If companies can not only secretly renegotiate the deals but also make sure that public records laws shield them from revealing that they did, then the contracts are meaningless. And we would argue that politicians are at the very least complicit with these private deals.

In the cases of New York and Virginia - the other state that received a new Amazon location as a part of its ""HQ2"" bidding process - the agreements they signed requires them to notify the online retailer of any public records requests in order to give it the opportunity to legally challenge them.

More broadly, secrecy pervades the entire process of economic development. For example, during the many months-long competition to win HQ2, Wisconsin officials purposely routed their Amazon bid through agencies not subject to public records requests, emails show. And cities like Austin and Los Angeles submitted their bids through non-public entities like the Chambers of Commerce as a way to shield them from public scrutiny.

When public records aren't public

Throughout the country we have observed exceptions to public records laws and ""creative"" ways government official can circumvent these laws.

And the costs of this lack of transparency can be high, as audits of economic development programs in New Jersey and New York show.

The scathing audit of New York's Excelsior Jobs Program found not only a lack of due diligence but also a staff that had changed the required number of jobs for companies that were falling short of their creation requirements. And this program would have also provided much of the incentives for Amazon's HQ2.

In other words, after politicians stage photo ops of company announcements, little is done to make sure companies are complying with these agreements.

Now that Amazon has pulled a Valentine's Day breakup with New York, it's worth considering who is to blame.

We think that the governor and mayor seriously miscalculated by negotiating a secret deal with Amazon and then proposing it as a take it or leave it offer to New Yorkers. Amazon may claim that it dumped New York, but it looks like the break-up was mutual.",166,Janice Bitters,13-Feb-19,Exclusive: Google To Take Another New Mountain View Office As It Gears Up For,541,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Exclusive: Google To Take Another New Mountain View Office As It Gears Up For

Google has leased a yet-to-be-built office building in Mountain View's East Whisman area as the search giant forges ahead on plans for expansion in its hometown and elsewhere in the South Bay.

A spokesperson for Mountain View-based Google confirmed Tuesday that the company has leased the entire approved 190,000-square-foot building set to rise at 600 Clyde Ave. The building is slated to be a five-story Class A office building with a sky deck, developed by Renault & Handley, a local developer, building management company and brokerage group.

The project, which also includes an adjacent three-level parking garage, originally gained city approvals in mid-2016, but the building is not yet under construction, according to recent city documents. Representatives for the Mountain View-based real estate firm didn't respond to a request for comment on the lease this week.

News of the deal comes mere weeks after the Business Journal reported that Alphabet Inc.-owned Google also snapped up 150,000 square feet of office space barely a mile away in a development at 620 National Ave. That lease was signed about a year after the four-story office property finished construction, developed by a local partnership known as National Avenue Partners.

Notably, coworking giant WeWork had been in negotiations on the National Avenue site for the better part of a year before Google sealed the deal within a matter of weeks ahead of 2019, according to several sources with knowledge of that arrangement.

""Given the two opportunities that were in front of the owners, the business decision was to go with somebody who was publicly traded and has a long history of good credit,"" Justin Reilly of Colliers International, who represented National Avenue Partners in the deal, told the Business Journal last month.

Google's South Bay expansion

While tech is growing at a rapid rate throughout Silicon Valley, Google's recent lease may be less of an expansion and more of a long-term option as the company systematically unveils plans for mixed-use campuses in Mountain View, Sunnyvale and eventually, San Jose.

Some of the land where the company is aiming to build those developments is already home to existing Google offices. That could be where some new leased space, like the Clyde Avenue building, come into play.

In late November, Google submitted master plans for the North Bayshore area, where it is the predominant land owner. The company has said it wants to build more than 6,000 new homes alongside about 3 million square feet of office and up to 300,000 square feet of community and retail space throughout the North Bayshore area.

On Feb. 26, Mountain View's City Council will review the request and decide how much more Google, already the city's largest employer, will be allowed to grow its office footprint.

Currently, the company is constructing its 595,000-square-foot Charleston East canopied office building near its headquarters and last year restarted work on its more than 600,000-square-foot Bay View project, which sits on NASA-owned land in Mountain View's Moffett Field.

HIGHLIGHT:еКStarcity, after paying $18 million in cash for a downtown San Jose site where a co-living residential tower will rise, now is seeking a construction loan for the development, which is slated to break ground this year.

SAN JOSE  Starcity has bought the site it needs to construct a co-living residential tower in downtown San Jose that would offer dormitory style habitation as a way to curb housing costs.

This is a huge milestone for this company, as well as for the project itself, Jon Dishotsky, chief executive officer of Starcity, said in an interview with this news organization. This is our largest land acquisition to date.

Starcity, acting through an affiliate, bought the downtown San Jose site at 199 Bassett St. on Feb. 8, according to Santa Clara County public documents.

We are very bullish about downtown San Jose, Dishotsky said. We have had our eye on this site for a very long time. San Jose is the next urban place in the Bay Area.

The co-living developer was bullish enough to pay $18 million in cash for the property, the county records show. The deal was arranged through brokers from the San Jose office of Cushman & Wakefield.

Among the reasons the buyers are optimistic: A burst of development activity is underway in downtown San Jose, investors have grabbed a widening number of properties in the area, and more tenants are moving into commercial spaces in the citys urban core.

Plus, big tech companies such as Google and Adobe have actively sketched out plans for major expansions in downtown San Jose for their operations.

This co-living project will definitely benefit the expansions in the area because there will be more housing options in downtown San Jose, saidеКErik Hallgrimson, an executive managing director with Cushman & Wakefield. This can create more affordable housing.

Although the Starcity affiliate paid cash for the project site, the developer must still scout for a lender to provide the funding, according to Dishotsky.

We have already received some term sheets for a construction loan, Dishotsky said. We hope to close that loan within the next month or two.

The development, which has been called Aviato in project proposals, is currently envisioned as an 18-story residential tower that would contain about 750 to 790 co-living units. The project is close to the Diridon train station and the site of a large transit village of offices, restaurants, shops, hotel rooms and homes proposed by Google.

We are taking an existing and approved project and we are applying our interior format to the development, Dishotsky said.

That format features tenants who rent tiny rooms in larger apartments that provide access to common necessities such as a kitchen and living room.

Each floor also would have gathering areas for activities such as doing work or the offering of amenities such as wellness classes that can include yoga sessions. Starcity wants to offer more than a long hallway flanked by a succession of doorways.

This will feel like a vertical neighborhood, Dishotsky said.",168,Fiona Kelliher,11-Feb-19,"Four Leases Later, Here's How Much Space Google Has In San Francisco",803,San Francisco Business Times (california),,"Four Leases Later, Here's How Much Space Google Has In San Francisco

Compared to Google's vast real estate holdings in the Bay Area and beyond, 1.53 million square feet of office space in San Francisco sounds like small change.

But in the past year, the search engine powerhouse has inked four leases in the city proper, increasing its footprint to the equivalent of about 26 football fields - and showing that its San Francisco appetite remains strong.

Recent deals include a new lease of about 300,000 square feet in One Market and a 57,299-square-foot expansion at 2 Harrison St. The company is also projected to lease up to about 180,000 square feet at 215 Fremont, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

As companies fight for space, there are fewer and fewer large buildings to go around. Case in point: Google, Amazon and Facebook all considered Park Tower - before Facebook ultimately signed a deal for the entire highrise. The next huge site to hit the market will be Oceanwide Center at First and Mission streets, which includes 1.1 million square feet of office space. But that won't come online until about 2023, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the leasing agent for the site.

It's not yet clear whether Google will be a contender for that space. The company opened its first San Francisco office in 2007 and now operates in at least eight offices in the city.

Google had 1,500 employees in San Francisco in January 2018, according to Business Times research estimates.

The biggest draw to the city? The young talent pool.

""San Francisco is a city a lot of people want to move to and want to live in,"" said Rebecca Prozan, Google's head of public affairs in California, in July.

For recent college graduates especially, busing all the way down to the Peninsula every day can be a drag, said Robert Sammons, research director at brokerage Cushman & Wakefield. Tech companies that have opened San Francisco offices primarily want to edge out their competitors in attracting and retaining a young workforce.

And as big companies establish themselves in San Francisco, it creates a feedback loop, Sammons said, in which software developers and other techies see no reason to move away given their array of employment options.

""On the employee side, if I don't like working for tech company X, there's company, A, B, C, D, E, F and G right around the corner, and I can go work for them,"" Sammons said.

So far, Google's San Francisco real estate strategy has been limited to leasing rather than buying, excepting one smaller site at 188 Embarcadero that it purchased in 2014. That stands in contrast with the rest of the Bay Area, where the company owns about half of its total 20 million-square-foot footprint, according to CoStar.

Click on the red markers on the map below to see images of the buildings, as well as square footage, address and status.

Leased and owned addresses provided by CoStar

The company also owns its Googleplex headquarters in Mountain View, which spans about 3 million square feet. It's also proposed a tech campus with up to 8 million square feet of commercial space in San Jose. Meanwhile in New York, Google shelled out a dazzling $2.4 billion for Chelsea Market.

But buying in San Francisco isn't out of the question if the right high-quality building cropped up, said Jesse Gundersheim, market economist with CoStar. Part of the problem is that the city has much less inventory than New York - about 83 million square feet as opposed to 401 million square feet in Manhattan alone - and fewer high-quality office buildings that Google would want to pay for upfront.

""Certainly you'll have more opportunity to acquire space on the leasing end in downtown San Francisco,"" Gundersheim said. ""[Google]'s acquiring it by any means they can, so it's easier to lease in the short-term in San Francisco.""

At the end of the day, though, the Peninsula's large swaths of land ""will always keep Silicon Valley as the mainstay for the tech industry,"" said Colin Yasukochi, director of research and analysis at brokerage CBRE. Of the tech industry's roughly 200 million square feet spread across the Bay Area, 70 percent is still located in Silicon Valley, with another 15 percent in San Francisco.

Expansion outside that bubble tends to stay concentrated in just a few submarkets that make the most sense for employees, Yasukochi said. For those like Google who have found that niche in San Francisco, paying the premium on rents is still worth it - especially because the tech giants have the cash on hand.

""The biggest, most financially capable tech companies will continue to expand in San Francisco,"" Yasukochi said. ""There are tenants whose leases will come up and who can no longer afford to stay here.""

A site slated to be San Jose's first downtown co-living development has officially traded hands for $18 million, marking a milestone for the ballyhooed 800-bedroom proposal by housing startup Starcity.

San Francisco-based Starcity on Friday closed on the 0.77-acre site at 199 Bassett St. via a limited liability company called 199 Bassett Owner LLC. The property sits about a mile from where Google Inc. is working on developing a proposal for a massive new mixed-use tech campus.

The co-living startup, known for making ""dorm living for adults"" in San Francisco and in Southern California, has been expected to purchase the site from Cupertino-based developer KT Urban since last year, but until now a timeline and price hadn't been revealed. The site was previously eyed by KT Urban for a traditional multifamily tower called Aviato, but in recent months has taken on a new life as Bassett, San Jose's first co-living development proposal.

""It's the culmination of 18 months of work,"" Shawn Milligan, partner at KT Urban, said of the sale in an interview with the Business Journal on Monday.

The company has spent the past year and a half ""targeting co-living operators around the United States and telling them about what San Jose has to offer for co-living and what co-living can offer downtown San Jose,"" he added.

KT Urban will continue being an adviser to Starcity throughout the process. The Cupertino developer, which is currently highly active in downtown San Jose with several project proposals, was represented by Erik Hallgrimson and Dave Schley of Cushman & Wakefield on the recent sale.

Currently, the development groups are working with the city of San Jose to see co-living added to San Jose's downtown zoning code. That would allow for the proposed 18-story tower to rise with somewhere between 700 and 800 bedrooms above ground-level retail that includes a ""compact urban market,"" according to Starcity's plans.

Both Starcity and KT Urban representatives said city officials have been supportive of the concept. Milligan praised city officials for ""moving at the speed of business,"" to make room for such a project in the city's development framework.

Co-living, a relatively new housing concept in the area, offers flexible, short-term leases for private bedrooms adjacent to shared common spaces, a model that allows for more residents in a building than a typical multifamily development. Many co-living buildings also offer a bevy of amenities, host resident activities or mixers and include the cost of shared household supplies in a fixed monthly rent cost.

""It provides an alternative for downtown high-rise living that is more economically feasible than apartments and or condos are right now,"" Hallgrimson said in an interview.

Indeed, the concept seems to be an enticing one for KT Urban, which earlier this month confirmed to the Business Journal it was considering proposing a second, 27-story co-living tower in downtown on a site where it had previously proposed a traditional residential project.

That project, known as Garden Gate, is not yet approved by the city, but KT urban is working on the required environmental study to gain those approvals.

In the meantime, the recent sale of the Bassett project is significant for a site that Starcity says could see a groundbreaking this year. ""It's a huge milestone, not only for the company, but for the project itself,"" Starcity spokesperson Erin First said in an interview. ""This is the largest land acquisition Starcity has done to date and we are really excited to have control of that land.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe airport commission and airport staff disagree over whether to dramatically change height limits.

With Google slated to build a massive campus in San Jose in the coming years and a development boom downtown, a fight is brewing over the possibility of allowing taller buildings near the airport.

The City Council is set to vote this month on whether to changeеКthe building height limits near Diridon Station and in the core of downtown. Taller buildings, the city's Office of Economic Development has argued, would bring in millions of dollars more in tax dollars each year and add new vibrancy to a city long known for its sprawl. The buildings, they say, will allow for more office space and housing higher up, and shops and restaurants below. Top airport officials, along with eager developers and business groups, have agreed.

But for the first time in recent memory, theеКcity's Airport Commission has broken with airport staff, suggesting the move could relegate Mineta San Jose International Airport to little more than a regional airport and lead to tragic accidents.

""From a safety standpoint, it's almost unfathomable,"" said Raymond Greenlee, a longtime Delta pilot and airport commissioner. ""I think, unfortunately, the money is going to talk.""

But airport officials have rebuffed those accusations.

""We would not recommend anything that wasn't safe,"" said Judy Ross, San Jose's assistant director of aviation, at a meeting of the San Jose Downtown Association on Friday morning.

The city and airport officials are backing what's been labeled Scenario 4, which would allow buildings to be anywhere from 5 to 35 feet taller in the downtown core and anywhere from 70 to 150 feet taller around Diridon Station.

The Federal Aviation Administration has a series of guidelines meant to protect the airspace around the airport. Regardless of what action the city takes, those will have to be met. Separately, each airline has its own procedure for what to do if there's an emergency and one of a plane's engines becomes inoperative, known as one engine inoperative or OEI. If that happens, planes need to be able to get high enough to avoid obstacles, circle back and land. Now, airlines can use a couple of corridors - one over downtown and one over the Diridon area - in case of an emergency. With taller buildings in the area, airlines would have to make some adjustments, such as carrying fewer passengers or cargo or less fuel.

For the city,еКit's an economic issue. And while taller buildingsеКmight reduce, for instance, the viability of long-haul flights to and from Asia, that's a trade-off officials are willing to make.

""We're not expected to compete with San Francisco, which has a substantial international market,"" said Ross, at a committee meeting in late January.

Ultimately, some airlines might have to bump passengers - which would mean providing hotel and food vouchers - or upgrade aircraft.

Councilman Johnny Khamis said he is concerned about the possible loss of international routes.

To offset airline losses, Ross suggested, San Jose could set up a program funded by local businesses and managed by a group like a Chamber of Commerce.

""It's just good city planning,"" said Kim Walesh, the city's director of economic development, during a recent phone interview.

Around Diridon especially, the change could result in some 8.6 million net square feet of new development and bring in billions in construction dollars. And, officials insist, there is no difference in safety.

But several commissioners worry taller buildings will mean a higher risk of accidents. They've backed what's been labeled Scenario 10B, which would preserve some of the current OEI procedures and allow somewhat taller buildings near Diridon, but not downtown.

""We're human beings and humans make mistakes,"" Greenlee said.

He's also concerned about the city bowing to Google's wishes. Back in 2007, the city studied height limits and decided not to allow taller buildings. But this time as they revisitedеКthe idea ofеКraising height limits,еКthe city hired a consultant to do a new study on the potential impact.еКAccording to briefing notes for Mayor Sam Liccardo obtained by this news organization, the city coordinated ""regularly"" with Google and an OEI consultant the company itself hired.

Then last summer, the city approved an agreement with Google, with the tech company paying the city $1.33 million to cover staff, consultants and other costs associated with their proposed development and planning for the Diridon Station area. One possibility for spending $100,000 of those funds, the agreement said, was on an OEI consultant.

But, Walesh said, the ""city did not in fact use any of the Google Service Reimbursement Funds to cover any of the expenses associated with the recent Airport Height Study; the study was paid for entirely out of airport funds.""

Google did not respond to a request for comment about the funds.

The idea, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, who was a councilman in 2007, that Google alone convinced the city to consider changing height limits now is ""wrong.""

The decision not to allow taller buildings in the mid-2000s, he continued, was economic. Back then, the airport was in a shaky spot financially and forcing airlines to rethink their OEI policies could have led to major airlines abandoning their San Jose routes. Today, that's unlikely.

And, the mayor said, ""having a pilot's license doesn't endow anyone with the expertise to overrule the extensive analysis undertaken by the FAA"" and other industry experts.

Ross Aimer, a retired United Airlines pilot and the CEO of Aero Consulting Experts, said San Jose should take a look at how other cities have fared before moving forward. In San Diego, he said, a tall parking garage near the airport has proven problematic.

""Pilots have been complaining,"" Aimer said. ""It makes it very difficult.""",171,Marisa Kendall,7-Feb-19,"Housing Crisis Solution? Build Near Bart, Bay Area Leaders Say",382,The East Bay Times (california),,"Housing Crisis Solution? Build Near Bart, Bay Area Leaders Say

The 200 politicians, corporate leaders, developers and transit providers who convened at LinkedIn's office in Mountain View last month are throwing their weight behind transit-oriented development.

The surveyеКwas the result of a plea by the Leadership Group for local influencers to take proactive steps to fix the housing shortage that is forcing prices up and families out of the area.еКAttendees, including Sen. Scott Wiener, representatives from Facebook and the heads of the region's major transportation agencies, were asked to commit time and money to at least three specific solutions - marking their choices on a slip of paper they turned in to the event organizers.

Carl Guardino, president and CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, has said the organization will follow up with attendees and encourage them to honor their commitments.

Transit-oriented development has become an increasingly popular option as Bay Area leaders face growing pressure to increase the region's housing supply. After a failed attempt last year, Wiener is trying again to pass a bill that would make it easier to build high-density developments near transit hubs. Former Gov. Jerry Brown signed a separate bill in September that streamlines housing development specifically around BART stations.

HIGHLIGHT:еКLocated at the old Toon's Piano Bar, it combines old-school arcade games with a modern and hip cocktail lounge and walk-up meal service.

SAN JOSE  Local entrepreneurs have breathed life into a long-shuttered building on a key corner of downtown San Jose, plunking down a bet that their new Miniboss bar and arcade is poised to become a hot new nightspot for the area.

Located at the former site of the long-closed Toons Piano Bar nightclub at 52 E. Santa Clara St. near Second Street, Miniboss has drawn its inspiration from Barcade in Manhattan, as well as similarly themed spots in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and combines old-school arcade games with a modern and hip cocktail lounge and walk-up meal service.

We are very optimistic about the trajectory of downtown San Jose, so we are hopeful about this, said one of the co-owners, Dan Phan.

Miniboss features old arcade machines, including a version of the legendary Street Fighter game, as well as a cocktail lounge on one side and a walk-up meal spot called Super Good Kitchen. The walls feature an array of art work, including bright murals from Local Color.

We wanted to combine kitschy and cool, said GeorgeеКLahlouh, another co-owner. Its playful, colorful and lively, combined with great food and drinks.

Phan said that, with partner Johnny Wang, he has been involved in downtown San Jose for several years. They became active a few years before plans emerged for two game-changing tech expansions in downtown San Jose. Wang is also a co-owner of Miniboss.

Google is planning a transit-oriented village of office buildings, homes, restaurants and shops near the Diridon train station where the search giant could employ 15,000 to 20,000.

San Jose-based Adobe intends to dramatically expand its three-building downtown headquarters campus with a fourth office tower where the cloud services giant would employ 4,000 people.

Even before Google, there was a lot more activity downtown than prior years, Phan said. Google sent it to another realm.

That heightened interest in the downtown extends to this specific building. In December, Foster City-based La Senda, aеКgroup of local realty investors, paid $13.95 million for the historic property, which is known as the Saratoga Capital Building.

The new Miniboss offers eight pinball machines and 32 arcade machines, Phan said. The name Miniboss is derived from the penultimate enemies that a video game player must defeat before attempting to beat the final boss whose demise bestows an ultimate victory on a player.

That corner has been dark for years since Toons closed its doors, said Scott Knies, executive director of the San Jose Downtown Association. Your heart just soars seeing the lights on and seeing a room full of people inside.

Around 2012, Phan and Wang opened Original Gravity Public House a couple of blocks away at 66 S. First St. and then in 2014, they launched Paper Plane at 72 S. First St. Lahlouh also has been part of the groups expanding nightlife empire in downtown San Jose.

These three are veteran downtown operators. This is their third downtown business, Knies said. They know the market. They know what they are doing. I would not be surprised to see it full every night. Referring to the nearby offices of co-working giant WeWork, Knies added, Miniboss will be WeWorks neighborhood bar.

Miniboss staged a soft launch this week, including Tuesday night. The official opening is slated for Thursday. That will include dinner service from the kitchen. In about a month, Miniboss intends to offer lunch.

We want to help bring this part of downtown to life, Lahlouh said. Miniboss has been well-received so far. We really want to activate this block.",173,,6-Feb-19,Google Inks Pact For New 35-storey Office Tower In Us: Report,191,Millennium Post Newspaper,,"Google Inks Pact For New 35-storey Office Tower In Us: Report

HIGHLIGHT:еКMayor Sam Liccardo wants to connect Diridon Station to Mineta San Jose International Airport.

CLICK HERE if you are having a problem viewing the photos or video on a mobile device

ImagineеКvisitors flying into San Jose descending from the airport into an underground tunnel, boarding a driverless car or some other contraption and zooming south a couple of miles to Diridon Station, the citys main transit hub.

Far-fetched, right? Maybe not.

SanеКJose Mayor Sam Liccardo said Tuesday he has been in talks with Elon Musks Boring Company about the possibility of creating this kind of underground link between Diridon Station and Mineta San Jose International Airport.

The announcement could bring welcome news for tourists, business workers and residents alike, who areеКoftenеКleftеКto hailеКa cab or ride-share service or wait for a bus. Meanwhile, the Bay Areas other major airports  in Oakland and San Francisco  are connected to BART.

For Liccardo, the possibility represents a chance for the station to grow with the city, the mayor told reportersеКat City Hall.

In the coming years, Google is expected to build a massive campus near Diridon, bringing thousands more people, jobs and homes to the area. And the station itself is expected to undergo an overhaul of its own, with BART eventually set to extend downtown and to the station. A half decade ago, the estimated cost for building a traditional rail link between the airport and station came in around $800 million. A tunnel project, Liccardo said, could potentially cost a fraction of that figure.

Its not that cost effective, Liccardo said of a traditional rail link. Weve been looking at alternatives.

But not everyone is thrilled with the idea of San Jose turning to a company run by Musk, who has been accused of labor violations and opposing unions.

Theres a lot of important decisions the city needs to make about Diridon Station and infrastructure and investments, and its really important that when we look at construction of our public works and operation of our public spaces that were working with employers that respect employees, said Jeffrey Buchanan, with the worker-advocacy group Working Partnerships USA.

Liccardo said any project would be subject to San Joses prevailing wage rules and that the city wasnt locked into working with Boring.

This is going to be open to everybody, the mayor said. What weve been exploring is the technology.

While no tunnel is imminent, Liccardo said he hopes to see whats known as a Request for Information, or RFI, go out in the next couple of months to companies such as Boring that might be able to build such a transit system.

For two consecutive years, the (airport) has been the fastest-growing airport in the United States, Liccardo wrote in a new memo to the rest of the City Council. City and regional leaders have long sought a means of connecting the airport to the rest of our emerging transit system.

Musks company isеКnow testing out an underground tunnel in Southern California. San Jose, Liccardo said, should explore a public-private partnership with Boring or another company to help connect airport passengers to downtown and vice versa.

When voters approved Measure A in 2000, Liccardo said, a people mover connecting the airport terminals to Caltrain, VTA Light Rail and BART, all of which will flow through Diridon, was among the most popular project proposals.

And Liccardo wants the city to think big, he said.

Nobody wants to make this more complex or difficult, he wrote, but if were planning the regions Grand Central Station for the next century, we shouldnt do so wearing blinders to the future.

Another regional transportation measure is likely to be on the ballot in the next six years, and the mayor wants city leaders to begin to think about how an airport connection might look ahead of that. Liccardo also envisions the airport becoming a car port in the future for Sharks fans and others attending events downtown, who could then take public transit close to Arena Green and the heart of the city.

We want to be sure that were ready to go, Liccardo said.

Editorial: Council must fulfill San Jose's Coyote Valley obligation

Things to know: Erik Karlsson skips Sharks trip to Winnipeg

In the same memo, Liccardo also said he wants the city to study ways to connect people to De Anza College, Valley Fair, the Apple headquarters and other places along the West San Carlos-Stevens Creek corridor, as well as the possibility of a transit line along Monterey Road.

Liccardo acknowledges that funding for and actual construction of such projects is unlikely to begin anytime soon but said he wants to create a space where new transit concepts can flourish, particularly when it comes to moving people from the airport to downtown.

Certainly our city isnt going to get any less crowded, and Gods not creating anymore land, Liccardo said, and so it is likely that if theres going to be a viable connection, its going to be underground.",176,Janice Bitters,5-Feb-19,Boston Properties Leader Says He's 'doubling Down' On San Jose With Big,725,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Boston Properties Leader Says He's 'doubling Down' On San Jose With Big

Boston Properties Inc. is reviving plans to turn a downtown San Jose parking lot it has owned for nearly two decades into a massive office project. This time, the company is more than doubling the size of its original vision as it tells investors that it plans to ""double down"" on San Jose.

The Boston-based development giant last week submitted plans to the city for a new building that would stand as high as 17 stories and include up to 1.8 million square feet of office space on a 3.67-acre site at the corner of South Almaden Boulevard and Woz Way. The rectangular property sits near the Children's Discovery Museum.

The company's newest proposal is significantly larger than the three-building, 860,000-square-foot project it has long envisioned for the site, a plan that has been gathering dust since 2003 as city officials granted the company about a half-a-dozen extensions on a development agreement for the property.

Boston Properties also recently signed on to be a part of an entitled 1.1 million-square-foot office development at 440 W. Julian St. with TMG Partners - not far from where Google is planning a massive new corporate campus. Boston Properties President Doug Linde told investors on an earnings call last week the latest investments are ""the double-down in downtown San Jose.""

Downtown San Jose's proximity to Caltrain and its future BART connections are big sellers, as is Google's vision to build between 6 million and 8 million square feet of office, housing and retail, he noted.

""What was once going to be an 800,000-plus-square-foot, either office or residential site at the Plaza at Almaden, we are now permitting for a minimum of 1.3 million square feet and could be larger than that,"" Linde told investors. The developer has already tapped CBRE's Sherman Chan, Jeff Houston and Mike Benevento to market the property.

So what makes this time different? For starters, there's no denying the momentum in downtown right now, according to Blage Zelalich, San Jose's downtown manager.

Not only has Google arrived with its own plans, but other companies and developers have started to flock to San Jose's urban core.

Adobe Inc., for instance, is building a fourth office tower that will allow the software maker to more than double its workforce at its headquarters. Other young, hip companies have grown or landed in downtown, including WeWork and Airbnb.

San Francisco-based developer Jay Paul Co. last year made an aggressive entrance into the city's downtown, spending more than $300 million on real estate. One of those properties - a block-long mixed-use campus called CityView Plaza - will be redeveloped. Industry insiders say the complex will likely double or even triple in size by the time the Jay Paul is done.

Boston Properties, the publicly traded developer behind San Francisco's Salesforce Tower, also brings major muscle, Zelalich said.

""They have a pretty A-List of clients, so my assumption is that they have been talking to the folks on their A-List of clients and those folks are interested,"" she said.

Linde assured investors last week ""the market has really changed down there,"" referring to San Jose's downtown. Indeed, Boston Properties has been watching the San Jose market for years.

The company purchased most of its site where it is now eyeing a big new office building along the banks of the Guadalupe River in 2000 from another private party. Two small pieces of the property were once owned by the Successor Agency to San Jose's Redevelopment Agency.

Though Boston Properties purchased that land from the agency in 2010 for $700,000, the company has a deal with the city to apply for a building permit by June 2019. If it misses that deadline, the ""Successor Agency has the right to repurchase the property if certain conditions regarding development are not met,"" according to city documents.

Richard Keit, managing director for the Successor Agency, said the city and developer have options, especially considering the recent proposal. ""This is a major project and it looks like they are going ahead,"" Keit told the Business Journal in an interview Tuesday. ""If things progress, we would probably extend the schedule of performance.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe Roosevelt Park Apartments would house nearly 80 low-income residents.

A new affordable housing development could rise in San Jose near Roosevelt Park, with some units targeted for formerly homeless people, youth out of foster care and the developmentally disabled.

Under the current plan, the Roosevelt Parks Apartments at 21 N. 21st Street near Santa Clara Street and Highway 101  would stand nine stories and include 79 apartments for low-income residents, according to a new memo from the citys housing director, Jacky Morales-Ferrand, and the budget director, Margaret McCahan.

On Tuesday, the City Council will consider approving a loan of around $9 million to support the project. The developers, First Community Housing, would still need to secure additional financing and work through the permitting process. But tentatively, construction is set to begin in the spring of 2020 and would be done around September 2021.

The new development is a badly needed dose of affordable housing in Silicon Valley, advocates say, where rents haveеКsoared to among the highest in the nation. San Jose alone has more than 4,000 homeless residents and many families have fled the South Bay for more affordable housing because they are unable to pay rent in an area where one-bedroom apartments regularly rent for close to $3,000.

In 2017, Mayor Sam Liccardo said he wanted San Jose to add 10,000 affordable homes by 2022. But few of those homes are ready for residents yet, even as the promise of a large Google campus just west of downtown has sent developers and companies scrambling to snap up property.

Forty of the buildings units would be set aside for formerly homeless people and their families, while 10 would be for youth transitioning out of foster care and 10 would go to developmentally disabled people. While many of the apartments would be geared toward individuals or small families, the building would include 14 three-bedroom units for larger families. One unit would be set aside for a building manager.

We just felt like the site was so perfect for family housing, said Ava Kuo, a senior project manager with First Community Housing, adding that housing insecurity among families with children is a real problem. Our vision is very much to try to create a place for families.

One floor of the LEED Platinum building would include more than 7,000 square feet of commercial space, and more than 2,000 square feet would be set aside for community space. That could include a computer lab or space for different nonprofits or agencies to meet with residents and offer things like career advice or mentoring. Two of the levels would be for parking.

The project, the memo says, could serve low- and moderate-income residents like fast food cooks, cashiers and even nurses and construction workers.

Located roughly a half mile from the planned Alum Rock/28th Street BART station, the development would be steps from the Roosevelt Community Center, San Jose High School, and the South Bay Sports Training and Batting Cages.

According to an initial study conducted by the city in December, the building would rise 85 feet tall, with the elevator shaft extending to 95 feet. Now, the site is vacant.

First Community Housing has several other low-income housing developments in the works, including a Leigh Avenue project for homeless seniors, and Second Street Studios, a project at the corner of South Second and Keyes streets, also for formerly homeless residents.

On Tuesday, the council will also consider whether to approve a loan of around $7 million to support the development of around 80 low-income housing units on Page Street off W. San Carlos Street. Separately, the council will vote on a separate loan of more than $11 million to go toward building more than 85 affordable apartments on Balbach Street, not far from the San Jose McEnery Convention Center.",178,George Avalos,4-Feb-19,Huge Office Campus Eyed Near Downtown San Jose's Guadalupe River,614,The East Bay Times (california),,"Huge Office Campus Eyed Near Downtown San Jose's Guadalupe River

HIGHLIGHT:еКA new downtown San Jose project proposal visualizes a sleek, curving office complex that would approximate the contours of the nearby Guadalupe River and could contain up to 1.8 million square feet of office space.

SAN JOSE  A major real estate company is planning a mega office campus in downtown San Jose near the banks of the Guadalupe River, a project that could accommodate several thousand workers, municipal documents show.

The proposal visualizes a sleek, curving office complex that would approximate the contours of the river as it meanders near the Childrens Discovery Museum.

Boston Properties has proposed a development that could contain up to 1.8 million square feet of office space, the equivalent of a big regional shopping mall. If built to that size, as many as 9,000 people could work in the offices.

You are seeing some smart money coming into downtown San Jose, said Bob Staedler, principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a land use and planning consultancy. Boston Properties is a major company, well capitalized. They developed the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco.

The gleaming new development would be located on South Almaden Boulevard between Woz Way and San Carlos Street and would be directly across from the San Jose McEnery Convention Center.

The interest in downtown San Jose is increasing, said Nick Goddard, a senior vice president with Colliers International, a commercial real estate firm. Once the ball gets rolling, it gains momentum and gets bigger and bigger. The big money is now leading the parade.

The wording in the application leaves open the potential for ground-floor retail or restaurant spaces, although specifics werent immediately available from the preliminary plans.

The campus could be 17 to 18 stories high, the planning documents indicated.

It is too early for us to comment on this application at this time, Helen Han, a marketing director with Boston Properties, said in an email response to this news organization.

CBRE brokers Sherman Chan, Jeff Houston and Mike Benevento are seeking tenants for the proposed offices. The new complex is aimed at attracting major tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, or Apple.

This definitely looks like space designed for a tech company, Staedler said. The project will have a lot of amenities, and the look and lighting and the large floors are all attractive to tech companies.

The South Almaden Offices proposal marks the second time in less than two months that Boston Properties has signaled a heightened involvement with an office complex that could be a game-changing development for downtown San Jose.

In December and January, Boston Properties obtained options to buy an ownership stake in the Platform 16 office campus project site, which would sprout adjacent to a different section of the Guadalupe River near the corner of Julian Street and Autumn Parkway.

Boston Properties then announced it had entered into an agreement to jointly develop the site with TMG Partners and Valley Oak Partners. That complex would total 1.1 million square feet.

A growing number of major players, including tech companies and developers, are pushing into the downtown area.

Google plans to develop a transit-oriented village of office buildings, stores, restaurants, homes and parks near the Diridon train station where 25,000 could work, including 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giant's employees.

San Jose-based Adobe intends to expand its three-building headquarters campus downtown by adding a striking new fourth office tower at an adjacent site.

Stalwart development firm Jay Paul intends a wide-ranging redevelopment of CityView Plaza, located near the Tech Museum. Jay Paul bought that big site in 2018, paying $283.5 million.

Boston Properties knows they are going to ride a wave for the downtown, Staedler said. And that wave points to the increasing urbanization and growth of downtown San Jose.",179,Emily Deruy,4-Feb-19,San Jose Devotes Nearly $100 Million To Affordable Housing,878,The East Bay Times (california),,"San Jose Devotes Nearly $100 Million To Affordable Housing

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe money will be spread across at least 11 projects.

In what marks the most significant investment San Jose has made in affordable housing inеКyears,еКthe city will devote nearly $100 million to nearly a dozen projects across the city over the next several years.

A total of eleven developments are expected to provide 1,144 apartments to formerly homeless residents, low-income seniors and other vulnerable groups, the city's Housing Department said in a memo released Monday.

""We're making this historic commitment in funding for the creation of more than 1,100 affordable homes because we need to use every tool possible in this battle against our housing crisis,"" Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a phone interview. ""We hope that other cities follow suit.""

The projects - which are slated to rise from downtown to east San Jose to the southern part of the city - will still need to come before the full City Council for final approval and are divided into three categories. Those in the first category are expected to apply for tax credits, a major milestone for affordable housing projects, within six months. Those in the second category are expected to apply within a year, and those in the third group within eighteen months. If everything goes according to plan, construction on many of the developments is expected to begin in the next several years.

The money will come in part from repayment of loans the city handed out when it had a redevelopment agency and a cityеКhousing fund that developers pay into when they build market-rate housing.

If all the projects are built, it would bring the city more than 20 percent of the way toward Liccardo's goal of adding 10,000 affordable apartments to San Jose's housing stock by 2022. The mayor said he thinks that goal is still achievable, but, he acknowledged, the city still has a long way to go.

""There's no question, we need to accelerate all of our efforts,"" Liccardo said. ""We're continuing to look for other approaches.""

Last year, voters narrowly rejected a ballot measure that would have contributed millions of dollars to affordable housing. But in the coming years, the city will negotiate a series of deals with Google, which plans to build a massive campus in San Jose. In return for permission to build out a large area west of Highway 87, the tech giant is expected to contribute a significant amount of money toward affordable housing, although the specifics are not yet clear.

According to Ragan Henninger, the deputy director of housing, the roughly $100 million the city is contributing to 11 projects will allow developers to leverage more than $500 million in funding from other sources. Many of the projects, for instance, will likely rely on Measure A funding, an affordable housing bond measure passed by Santa Clara County voters in 2016.

In total, slightly more than a quarter of the more than 1,100 units will be housing for formerly homeless people. Ten percent will be housing for seniors, five percent will be housing for developmentally disabled people, three percent will be for youth transitioning out of foster care, one percent will be set aside for building managers, and the bulk, 55 percent, will be for low-income individuals and families.

Most of the units - 38 percent - will be studios, while slightly less than a quarter will be one-bedroom apartments. Twenty-three percent will be two-bedroom units, and 14 percent will be three-bedroom homes for families.

Overall, 31 percent of the apartments will go to people earning 30 percent or less of the area's median income, or about $30,000 for one person. Five percent of the units will go toward households with moderate incomes, up to 80 percent of the area's median income, or just shy of $71,000 for one person. Before recent tax law changes, according to the Housing Department's memo, these households could not qualify for affordable housing, but were priced out of market-rate housing.

While the funding won't cure the city's affordable housing woes and officials are exploring a range of other ideas to address the issue, it ""is an opportunity for us to actually act while we are continuing to develop these ideas that will bring resources and scale to our effort,"" Liccardo said. ""This is going to take a village.""

SAN JOSE - Eight protesters arrested after disrupting a City Council meeting last year over Google's plans to build a huge campus will not be prosecuted - at least for now, the district attorney's office announced Monday.

Nonetheless, the self-described ""Google 8"" and three dozen others rallied on Monday in front of the Santa Clara County Courthouse against what they see as a land grab that will favor the wealthy at the expense of the working poor who can't afford to live here.

""We're going to keep speaking out because this isn't over,"" said Liz Gonzalez, a community organizer with Silicon Valley De-Bug and one of the eight who had been arrested Dec. 4 on misdemeanor charges of disturbing a public meeting.

Criminal cases against protesters are difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to a panel of 12 jurors, Rosen said, and it's important ""to balance free speech with public safety and order.""

San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, meanwhile, said that while he believes the elements were met for arresting and charging the protesters, he respects and agrees with the district attorney's decision.

What exactly the Google project will encompass is uncertain, although officials say it will include a Google campus, retail, housing and parks in a mile-long strip emanating from an expanded Diridon transit station.

At the Dec. 4 council meeting, despite the protesters' objections, the City Council voted unanimously to sell $100 million worth of city property west of Highway 87 to the Mountain View-based tech giant.

City leaders are anxious for the project to go through, touting the economic benefits in a city that has long been suburban housing-heavy and jobs-light compared with other Bay Area cities. Council members came under criticism, however, for signing nondisclosure agreements with Google before the property sales.

The developer behind a plan to build a 27-story residential tower in downtown San Jose says the project could turn into the city's second co-living proposal.

KT Urban first unveiled plans for a 290-unit residential project called Garden Gate at 600 S. First St. in downtown San Jose about a year ago. But in the past couple of months, the Cupertino-based developer has begun to shift its vision for the development from a traditional residential building to a relatively new housing concept known as co-living.

""We are currently evaluating programming alternatives and are looking to build optionality into our entitlements,"" Shawn Milligan, partner at KT Urban, told the Business Journal in an email.

Currently, the group is working on getting approvals from the city to build Garden Gate, and as part of that process, KT Urban will study the environmental impacts of development. Milligan says the company will analyze not only the original 290-unit proposal, but also a much denser co-living option in the study.

Co-living, sometimes branded as ""dorm living for adults,"" offers flexible, short-term leases for private bedrooms adjacent to shared common spaces, a model that allows for more residents in a building than a typical multifamily development. Many co-living buildings also offer a bevy of amenities, host resident activities or mixers and include the cost of shared household supplies in a fixed monthly rent cost.

The Garden Gate project is the second location that KT Urban has envisioned for a potential co-living development in the city.

Last October, KT Urban and Starcity, a San Francisco-based co-living development startup, also unveiled plans to re-entitle an already approved traditional residential project at 199 Bassett St. in downtown San Jose, about a mile from where Google is making plans for a new corporate mega campus.

Starcity co-founder and CEO, Jon Dishotsky, told the Business Journal late last year that he was working to purchase the site from KT Urban. Once the sale is final, the co-living startup intends to work with KT Urban on the development, which could become home to as many as 800 bedrooms, Dishotsky said.

Likewise, Milligan told the Business Journal that KT Urban is invested in the concept of co-living.

""Over the last 18 months, we have been working with a number of co-living operators like Starcity, Common, Ollie, Opendoor and others to find market driven solutions to the housing crisis,"" he said.

Milligan said he wasn't yet in a position to say which of those companies KT Urban would work with on the Garden Gate project, should it become a co-living development.

The site is in San Jose's SoFA district, near where the 232-unit The Pierce opened in 2017 and where Core Cos. is wrapping up construction on the 105-unit residential development known as SparQ. Both of those developments have been ""catalysts for the immediate neighborhood,"" Milligan said.

As KT Urban works out the details of its Garden Gate project, the city of San Jose has started thinking about how to become more welcoming to such developments.

Currently, the city doesn't have a box that co-living fits into in its zoning code. Earlier this month officials kicked off a process aimed at adding co-living to existing development rules for the downtown.

""We need to insert more flexibility in our rules to allow more innovation to happen,"" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said last week during the Silicon Valley Business Journal's ""The Future of Downtown San Jose"" event.

He praised KT Urban Principal, Mark Tersini, for the company's work on both co-living projects, adding: ""They need flexibility in the rules and we are pushing to give them that flexibility.""

San Francisco, Feb. 2 -- Continuing with its investment spree in the US real estate, Google has reportedly signed a lease for a 35-storey tower in Austin which is scheduled to be ready for occupancy in the second quarter of 2022.

The construction of the tower which could potentially provide room for 5,000 workers has already begun, the Austin-American Statesman newspaper reported on Thursday.

Google, however, did not comment on the transaction.

The new tower at West Cesar Chavez and Nueces streets will have 790,000 square feet of space, according to the report, which cites local real estate sources.

The news of the investment comes as Google's parent company, Alphabet, reports earnings on Monday.

In December, the search giant announced a $1-billion investment for a new campus in New York City, CNBC reported.

In November, Google announced it would spend $100 million for 21 acres of land for a ""mega campus"" in San Jose near its headquarters in Mountain View, California.

Earlier in 2018, Google also acquired the Chelsea Market in Manhattan for $2.4 billion - which was disclosed as the biggest real estate purchase of 2018 in the US.

As the mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo knows it's not easy, or sometimes even feasible, to develop real estate projects in the Bay Area's largest city.

The blame lays at least in part with City Hall, he acknowledged on Thursday during the Silicon Valley Business Journal's ""The Future of Downtown San Jose"" event, hosted at the Rotary Summit Center.

""We can't do anything about business cycles, but we know that development costs right now are keeping a lot of folks from getting shovels in the ground,"" Liccardo said.

For starters, San Jose's development fees are ""not low,"" Liccardo acknowledged. Those costs are also calculated via a complicated fee structure that he laments can send developers into a game of ""bureaucratic pinball"" between government departments to find out how much a development will cost.

That's a problem in a city that has not only planned for significant jobs and housing growth - particularly in the urban core - but seems poised to finally realize the investment that leaders have been hoping to see for decades.

Downtown San Jose, for instance, has more than 30 development projects in its pipeline totaling more than 23 million square feet of potential new office space, 7,600 new residential units and more than 650 new hotel rooms, according to a recent tally of proposed projects in the commercial core by the Business Journal. Yet a tiny fraction of that is actually under construction.

While the city of San Jose can't change many of the costs that developers face, including the price of land, labor, construction materials or trade wars, Liccardo told attendees Thursday: ""There are some things we can do, though, to help.""

Indeed, the mayor, recently elected for a second term in the South Bay city that has branded itself ""The Capital of Silicon Valley,"" offered three initiatives he'd prioritize this year to make previously infeasible projects come to fruition.

1) Reduce and simplify fees

The city of San Jose will move ahead with a development study in the coming weeks so the City Council can assess how feasible development is in parts of the city.

""We are going to have to reduce fees where we know that development is infeasible,"" Liccardo told event attendees.

Lower development costs is music to the ears of any developer, but the part of the mayor's speech that drew cheers was his promise to work to simplify those fees.

""We want to create a one-stop shop so you have one fee and the city will figure out how to allocate it,"" he said. ""You will only know what the bill is, rather than having to jump around City Hall to figure it out.""

2) Be more flexible about rules

This month the city of San Jose began working on adjusting the zoning code to allow co-living residential units, often viewed as dorm living for adults, to rise in the downtown.

Housing startup Starcity proposed building a 700-bed co-living project on a downtown San Jose site that Cupertino-based developer KT Urban had previously entitled for a more traditional multifamily project. Now the groups are asking the city to consider the relatively new concept that would allow more units to rise at a lower cost to tenants.

""Mark Tersini [principal of KT Urban] and Starcity ... are doing incredible work on a co-living project,"" Liccardo said. ""But they need flexibility in the rules, and we are pushing to give them that flexibility.""

3) Consider taller height limits

On Feb. 26, the San Jose City Council will discuss a plan to allow taller buildings in the downtown core and in the Diridon Station area, where Google is planning a massive new mixed-use campus.

The city currently follows rules adopted about a decade ago that limit the height of towers in downtown and around the city's transit station to accommodate planes coming and going from nearby Mineta San Jose International Airport.

City officials now say national practices have changed and they're pushing for the city to adopt Federal Aviation Administration height limits, which would allow for taller buildings in downtown. Some members of the city's Airport Commission, which serves as an advisory board to the city council, have raised objections to the potential change. Some in that group have cited safety concerns or potential losses in revenue to the airport if buildings rise taller.

If approved, most of that height would show up around Diridon Station, but new buildings in the downtown core would be allowed to rise between five and 35 feet higher than they are permitted to today.

In all, the change would allow about 8.6 million square feet of additional development to rise in and around the downtown core, which Liccardo calls ""essential"" for downtown development.

""We know that if we can't control the cost, at least we can drive more revenues,"" he said. ""Hopefully that will help counterbalance the rising costs.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКGoogle's interest in creation of a transit-oriented village near the Diridon train station, along withеКlow costs for land and office spaces and the prospect of increasing rail connections near relatively plentiful housing, were among the factors cited by the experts in making the case for downtown San Jose as a new economic boomtown.

SAN JOSE - Downtown San Jose is becoming a magnet to a widening array of tech companies, large and small, that seek urban settings close to transit, according to a panel of commercial real estate experts.

Google's interest in creation of a transit-oriented village near the Diridon train station, along withеКlow costs for land and office spaces and the prospect of expanding rail connections near relatively plentiful housing, were among the factors cited by the experts making the case for downtown San Jose as a new economic boomtown. The observations emerged during a meeting sponsored by the San Jose office of SPUR, a non-profit urban planning group.

Matthew Lituchy, chief investment officer with Jay Paul, a veteran real estate company that is one of the Bay Area's most successful developers with big projects in hotbeds such as Mountain View and Sunnyvale, said his company constantly scouts for locales potentially attractive to tech companies.

""We realized that everything we were looking for, an urban setting with plenty of transit, was right here in downtown San Jose,"" Lituchy said during a discussion at the SPUR event in San Jose on Jan. 30.

San Francisco-based development firm Jay Paul has done more than look downtown. The developer, whose Silicon Valley tenants include Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, is grabbing choice sites in the urban core of the Bay Area's largest city.

In July 2018, an affiliate controlled by Jay Paul paid $283.5 million for CityView Plaza, a huge complex of offices, shops and restaurants bounded by West San Fernando Street, South Almaden Boulevard, Park Avenue and South Market Street.

A few weeks later, a Jay Paul affiliate paid $46 million for the old JCPenney building at North First and West Santa Clara streets.

""We bought CityView Plaza and that is going to be a major redevelopment at some point,"" Lituchy said. ""It will be an architecturally significant project. We are really excited about our plans for CityView Plaza.""

Enough projects are being contemplated by developers that downtown San Jose could gain 50,000 to 70,000 jobs if they're all built, according to estimates presented at the meeting.

That would be more than double the current downtown job base of roughly 43,000, a figure included in a June 2018 report released by the city's Office of Economic Development.

""We will see growth in downtown San Jose from emerging tech companies along with major tech companies,"" said Mark Schmidt, senior managing director for the San Jose office of CBRE, a commercial realty brokerage.

Both Schmidt and Lituchy said they hear from their tech clients that more than a few young tech professionals have become increasingly disillusioned by the prospect of riding in buses for hours a day to reach their offices in big campuses in Silicon Valley.

""Recruitment and retaining talent is the most important thing for a tech company, and their employees want to be in urban environments close to transit,"" Schmidt said. ""Mega campuses don't work any longer."" Referring to downtown San Jose, Schmidt added, ""More tech companies want to be here.""

San Jose-based Adobe Systems is planning a major expansion of its three-building headquarters campus downtown with the proposed construction of a fourth office tower at an adjacent site, an addition that would accommodate thousands of new tech workers.

The largest single change on the horizon for downtown San Jose is Google's proposal for a transit village of office buildings, homes, restaurants, shops and open spaces where 25,000 people could work, including 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giant's employees.

A short distance from the Google areas of interest, Boston Properties, TMG Partners and Valley Oak Partners have teamed up to jointly develop a 1.1-million-square-foot tech campus of three big office buildings that would be perched on the banks of the Guadalupe River.",187,Marlize Van Romburgh,30-Jan-19,Boston Properties Partners With Tmg On Massive San Jose Office Development Near,557,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Boston Properties Partners With Tmg On Massive San Jose Office Development Near

Boston Properties, one of the largest office space developers in the U.S., has teamed up with two Bay Area firms on a planned 1.1 million-square-foot office campus near San Jose's Diridon Station and search giant Google's future campus in the heart of the city.

Boston Properties said Wednesday that it has entered into a 65-year ground lease agreement with San Francisco-based TMG Partners and San Jose-based Valley Oak Partners for the site at 440 W. Julian St. known as Platform 16. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

TMG and Valley Oak last year secured final city approvals for the project.

""At the site of one of the biggest technology hubs in the country, Platform 16 will help companies attract and retain the best and brightest minds to the area by offering easy access to public transportation, housing, culture, food and entertainment in the heart of San Jose,"" Boston Properties Executive Vice President Bob Pester said in a statement.

The 5.4-acre project is slated to include three office buildings, designed by New York City-based architecture firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates.

The developers emphasized that the project will feature ""large floorplates"" ranging from 25,000 to 90,000 square feet. The buildings will have 15-foot floor-to-floor heights, 16 outdoor terraces, indoor and outdoor workspaces and amenities including a fitness and wellness facility and conference center.

""TMG and Boston Properties share the vision of a modern office campus that addresses the top priorities of today's growing companies: a location uniquely transit-accessible, access to affordable housing with San Jose the number one housing-to-jobs ratio in the Bay Area, and a facility that promotes collaboration and efficiency through large floorplates and multiple outdoor spaces,"" Matt Field, TMG's chief investment officer, said in a statement. ""The building's location will also allow employees to enjoy an exciting urban environment with the adjacent SAP Center, San Pedro Market, and the wide variety of cultural, culinary, and entertainment experiences in downtown San Jose.""

The developers said they expect demolition to begin this spring and to break ground this summer, with an estimated completion date ""as early as 2021."" Boston Properties will have a one-year option in February 2020 to acquire the land at a fixed cost, it said.

Sherman Chan, Mark Schmidt, Mike Charters and Will Schmidt of CBRE are marketing the project for lease on behalf of Boston Properties and TMG.

""This planned development will help bring thousands of jobs into our city center with easy access to public transit, and include a number of public space improvements that will help connect the Guadalupe River Park to Platform 16 and the rest of the Diridon Station area,"" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a statement.

The Platform 16 project is adjacent to Alphabet Inc.-owned Google's plans to build a sprawling, transit-connected urban campus in San Jose for as many as 20,000 workers. Those plans, which are still in the early stages, moved forward last year when the city agreed to sell a spate of publicly owned parcels near downtown to the company for almost $100 million.

Financial results for the year ended DecemberеК31, 2018 include:

еб    Net income attributable to common shareholders of $572.3 million, or $3.70 per diluted share (EPS), compared to $451.9 million, or $2.93 per diluted share, for FY 2017. еб    FFO of $974.5 million, or $6.30 per diluted share, compared to FFO of $959.4 million, or $6.22 per diluted share, for the year ended DecemberеК31, 2017.

The reported results are unaudited and there can be no assurance that these reported results will not vary from the final information for the quarter and year ended DecemberеК31, 2018.

EPS and FFO per Share Guidance:

The Company's guidance for the first quarter and full year 2019 for EPS (diluted) and FFO per share (diluted) is set forth and reconciled below. Except as described below, the estimates reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this release and otherwise referenced during the conference call and in the Company's Supplemental Operating and Financial Data for the quarter ended DecemberеК31, 2018. The estimates do not include possible future gains or losses or the impact on operating results from other possible future property acquisitions or dispositions, other possible capital markets activity or possible future impairment charges. EPS estimates may be subject to fluctuations as a result of several factors, including changes in the recognition of depreciation and amortization expense and any gains or losses associated with disposition activity. The Company is not able to assess at this time the potential impact of these factors on projected EPS. By definition, FFO does not include real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment losses on depreciable real estate or gains or losses associated with disposition activities. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth below. For details of the Company's assumptions related to guidance for the first quarter and full year 2019 for EPS (diluted) and FFO per share (diluted), please see the Fourth Quarter 2018 Supplemental Operating and Financial Data located on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.bostonproperties.com .

As set forth below, the Company has updated its projected EPS (diluted) for the full year 2019 toеК$3.05 - $3.17еКper share fromеК$3.07 - $3.24 per share. This is a decrease of approximatelyеК$0.05еКper share at the mid-point of the Company's guidance provided on October 30 due to $0.06 per share greater than expected portfolio performance and fee income and $0.05 per share lower than expected interest expense, offset by $0.16 per share increased depreciation expense resulting from placing new developments in service and accelerated depreciation from the demolition of a recently-entitled new development project.

In addition, the Company has updated its projected guidance range for FFO per diluted share for the full year 2019 toеК$6.88 - $7.00 per share fromеК$6.75 - $6.92 per share. This is an increase of approximatelyеК$0.11еКper share at the mid-point of the Company's guidance provided on October 30 and results from $0.06 per share greater than expected portfolio performance and fee income and $0.05 per share lower than expected interest expense.

(еКеКPursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by 1  the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate )  Investment Trusts (""Nareit""), we calculate Funds from Operations, or ""FFO,"" by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and real estate-related depreciation and amortization. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure, but we believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO and FFO per share to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO per share can help investors compare the operating performance of a company's real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.

Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently.

In order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company's operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company's financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

BOSTON, Jan. 29 -- Boston Properties issued the following news release:

Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE: BXP), one of the largest publicly-traded developers, owners and managers of Class A office properties in the United States, reported results today for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018.

Financial highlights for the fourth quarter include:

* Net income attributable to common shareholders of $148.5 million, or $0.96 per diluted share (EPS), growth of 43% compared to $103.8 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to asset sales during the fourth quarter of 2018.

* Funds from Operations (FFO) of $245.7 million, or $1.59 per diluted share. This reflects FFO growth of 7% compared to FFO of $230.1 million, or $1.49 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher revenue.

- FFO of $1.59 per diluted share was equal to the mid-point of the Company's fourth quarter guidance provided on October 30, as updated on December 11, 2018, when the Company announced the $0.10 per diluted share loss from early extinguishment of debt related to the early redemption of $700.0 million of 5.875% senior notes due 2019.

The Company provided guidance for first quarter 2019 with projected EPS of $0.66 - $0.68 per diluted share and projected FFO of $1.66 - $1.68 per diluted share.

The Company also reduced its full year 2019 EPS guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint and increased its full year 2019 FFO guidance by $0.11 at the midpoint compared to guidance provided on October 30, 2018.

The Company's updated guidance for FY 2019 is:

* Projected EPS for 2019 of $3.05 - $3.17 per diluted share, which would reflect a decrease in EPS of $0.59 at the midpoint compared to FY 2018. FY 2018 included a $0.99 per diluted share gain related to asset sales which is not projected in FY 2019 guidance.

* Projected FFO for 2019 of $6.88 - $7.00 per diluted share, which would reflect FFO growth of 10% at the midpoint as compared to FY 2018.

Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 include:

* Net income attributable to common shareholders of $572.3 million, or $3.70 per diluted share (EPS), compared to $451.9 million, or $2.93 per diluted share, for FY 2017.

* FFO of $974.5 million, or $6.30 per diluted share, compared to FFO of $959.4 million, or $6.22 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. FFO of $6.30 per diluted share was equal to the mid-point of the Company's FY 2018 guidance provided on October 30, as updated on December 11, 2018, when the Company announced the $0.10 per diluted share loss from early extinguishment of debt related to the early redemption of $700.0 million of 5.875% senior notes due 2019.

Full Year 2018 business highlights include:

* Delivered and placed in-service 2.3 million square feet (sf) of new developments representing $1.5 billion of investment, including Salesforce Tower in San Francisco, California, Proto Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Signature at Reston in Reston, Virginia and 191 Spring Street in Lexington, Massachusetts. The commercial developments are 100% leased.

* Continued 5.3 million square feet of additional developments, representing a total estimated investment of $2.7 billion. The commercial developments are 78% pre-leased.

* Acquired Santa Monica Business Park, a 1.2 million square foot office park located in Santa Monica, California in a joint venture; and entered into a joint venture to acquire a development site at 3 Hudson Boulevard in New York, New York that can accommodate up to 2.0 million square feet of future development.

* Signed leases for 7.2 million square feet during the year, marking one of the strongest leasing years in the Company's history.

* Increased portfolio occupancy 70 bps year-over-year to 91.4% for the Company's in-service office properties.

* Increased the regular quarterly dividend 18.75% to $0.95 per share of common stock in the third quarter, representing the largest quarterly dividend increase in the Company's history.

* Ranked in the top quadrant of the 2018 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) assessment, earning a seventh consecutive ""Green Star"" recognition and the highest GRESB 5-star Rating. Also in 2018, the Company signed a renewable energy agreement for the power consumption at 33 properties totaling 15 million square feet, which will reduce the carbon emissions from the Company's Massachusetts operations by 78%.

Fourth quarter and recent business highlights include:

* Entered into an agreement with an affiliate of TMG Partners (""TMG"") to develop Platform 16, an urban campus in downtown San Jose, California, which is located within walking distance of the Diridon Station, San Jose's intermodal transportation hub and adjacent to Google's planned eight million square foot transit village. Starting in January 2019, the Company is making ground rent payments to TMG through February, 2020 totaling $5.5 million. In February 2020, the Company will have an option for 12-months to acquire the land at a fixed price.

* Signed three long-term leases at its 399 Park Avenue property located in midtown New York City, totaling approximately 550,000 sf, which brings the property to approximately 93% leased.

* Completed a $1.0 billion green bond offering of 4.500% unsecured senior notes due 2028 and utilized $700 million of the proceeds to redeem its 5.875% senior notes due in 2019.

Other events during the fourth quarter include:

Development Activities

* Completed and fully placed in-service Salesforce Tower, its 1.4 million square foot Class A office project in San Francisco, California on December 1, 2018. The property is 100% leased.

* Completed and fully placed in-service 191 Spring Street, its 171,000 square foot Class A office redevelopment project in Lexington, Massachusetts on November 9, 2018. The property is 100% leased.

Acquisition and Disposition Activities

* Entered into a distribution agreement on December 31, 2018 with its partner in a joint venture in which the Company has a 50% interest, whereby the joint venture distributed its Annapolis Junction Building One, a 118,000 sf property, to the partner including the assumption by the partner of the mortgage indebtedness collateralized by the property. The Company recognized a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $8.3 million.

* Completed the sale of a 41.0-acre parcel of land at its Tower Oaks property in Rockville, Maryland for a gross sale price of approximately $46.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $25.9 million, resulting in a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $15.7 million. The Company has agreed to provide seller financing to the buyer totaling $19.5 million, which matures on December 20, 2021.

* Completed the sale of 6595 Springfield Center Drive (TSA Headquarters), a 634,000 sf development project in Springfield, Virginia on December 13, 2018, for a sale price of approximately $98.1 million, consisting of the land and project costs incurred to date. Concurrently with the sale, the Company agreed to act as development manager and has guaranteed the completion of the project. The company will earn a development fee, guarantee fees and a tenant improvement management fee and has the right to collect any contingency funds that are included but not used in the construction of the project. The estimated total project costs including the land are approximately $313.7 million. Because the carrying value of the property exceeded the estimated net sales price, the Company recognized an impairment loss totaling approximately $8.7 million in the fourth quarter 2018.

* Completed the sale of 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, a 315,000 square foot property in Washington, DC on November 30, 2018, for a gross sale price of approximately $142.0 million, including the retention of a $5.5 million payment by the anchor tenant due in January 2020. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $133.7 million, resulting in a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $44.4 million.

Capital Markets Activities

* A joint venture in which the Company has a 50% interest extended the loan collateralized by its Annapolis Junction Building Six property. At the time of the extension, the outstanding balance of the loan totaled approximately $13.1 million and was scheduled to mature on November 17, 2018. The extended loan has a total commitment amount of approximately $14.3 million, bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum and is scheduled to mature on November 17, 2020.

Transactions completed subsequent to December 31, 2018:

* Completed the sale of 2600 Tower Oaks Boulevard, a 179,000 sf property in Rockville, Maryland on January 24, 2019 for a gross sales price of approximately $22.7 million. The Company recognized an impairment loss totaling approximately $3.1 million during the fourth quarter 2018 as a result of the carrying value of the property exceeding its fair value.

* Amended the venture agreement the Company has with its partner in the consolidated entity that owns Salesforce Tower on January 18, 2019. Under the amendment, the partner exercised its right to cause the Company to purchase the partner's promoted profits interest in Salesforce Tower for cash totaling approximately $187 million net of the repayment of the Company's preferred equity. As part of the original agreement the partner was required to contribute 5% of the equity and was entitled to receive an additional promoted payment based on the success of the property.

* Exercised its right to acquire land parcels at Carnegie Center in Princeton, New Jersey on January 10, 2019, for a purchase price of approximately $42.9 million. The seller will be entitled to receive additional payments in the future aggregating approximately $8.6 million, which are contingent on the development of each of the parcels. The land parcels could support approximately 1.7 million sf of development.

The reported results are unaudited and there can be no assurance that these reported results will not vary from the final information for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2018. In the opinion of management, the Company has made all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of these reported results.

EPS and FFO per Share Guidance:

The Company's guidance for the first quarter and full year 2019 for EPS (diluted) and FFO per share (diluted) is set forth and reconciled below. Except as described below, the estimates reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this release and otherwise referenced during the conference call and in the Company's Supplemental Operating and Financial Data for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The estimates do not include possible future gains or losses or the impact on operating results from other possible future property acquisitions or dispositions, other possible capital markets activity or possible future impairment charges. EPS estimates may be subject to fluctuations as a result of several factors, including changes in the recognition of depreciation and amortization expense and any gains or losses associated with disposition activity. The Company is not able to assess at this time the potential impact of these factors on projected EPS. By definition, FFO does not include real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment losses on depreciable real estate or gains or losses associated with disposition activities. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth below. For details of the Company's assumptions related to guidance for the first quarter and full year 2019 for EPS (diluted) and FFO per share (diluted), please see the Fourth Quarter 2018 Supplemental Operating and Financial Data located on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.bostonproperties.com.

As set forth below, the Company has updated its projected EPS (diluted) for the full year 2019 to $3.05 - $3.17 per share from $3.07 - $3.24 per share. This is a decrease of approximately $0.05 per share at the mid-point of the Company's guidance provided on October 30 due to $0.06 per share greater than expected portfolio performance and fee income and $0.05 per share lower than expected interest expense, offset by $0.16 per share increased depreciation expense resulting from placing new developments in service and accelerated depreciation from the demolition of a recently-entitled new development project.

In addition, the Company has updated its projected guidance range for FFO per diluted share for the full year 2019 to $6.88 - $7.00 per share from $6.75 - $6.92 per share. This is an increase of approximately $0.11 per share at the mid-point of the Company's guidance provided on October 30 and results from $0.06 per share greater than expected portfolio performance and fee income and $0.05 per share lower than expected interest expense.

HIGHLIGHT:еКBoston Properties and TMG will team up to develop the Platform 16 project, building 1.1 million square feet of modern offices on a site that now consists primarily of an older office building, aging industrial parcels and a parking lot.

SAN JOSE  Three big developers have struck a deal to jointly develop whats deemed to be a potentially game-changing project in downtown San Jose, a proposed million-square-foot tech campus perched near the banks of the Guadalupe River and the edge of Googles future transit village.

Boston Properties has obtained an interest in the Platform 16 tech campus, a city-approved project whose owners include an affiliate of TMG Partners and Valley Oak Partners. Demolition of existing structures on the property, as well as site preparation, is due to begin this spring, and a formal groundbreaking is slated for summer.

This planned development will help bring thousands of jobs into our city center with easy access to public transit, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said. It will include a number of public space improvements that will help connect the Guadalupe River ParkеКto Platform 16 and the rest of the Diridon Station area. The complex is due to be complete as soon as 2021.

Boston Properties and TMG will team up to jointly develop the site, which now consists primarily of an older office building, aging industrial parcels and a parking lot.

At the site of one of the biggest technology hubs in the country, Platform 16 will help companies attract and retain the best and brightest minds to the area by offering easy access to public transportation, housing, culture, food and entertainment in the heart of San Jose, said Bob Pester, a Boston Properties executive vice president.

The 1.1-million-square-foot complex is expected to be marketed to one or more tech or telecommunications giants.

TMG and Boston Properties share the vision of a modern office campus that addresses the top priorities of today's growing companies: a location uniquely transit-accessible, access to affordable housing with San Jose the number one housing-to-jobs ratio in the Bay Area, and a facility that promotes collaboration and efficiency, said Matt Field, TMGs chief investment officer.

The Platform 16 project is bounded by Autumn Parkway, West Julian Street, North Autumn Street and a railroad line, and is just south of a Target store thats part of the bustling San Jose Market Center. Its also on the edge of neighborhoods where Google has collected numerous properties for a future transit-oriented development near the Diridon train station and SAP Center.

The involvement of Boston Properties in Platform 16 suggests that a widening array of major developers are interested in downtown San Jose. In recent months, big players such as Jay Paul, John DiNapoli, Sobrato Organization and Gary Dillabough have either bought large properties at key development sites, or have unveiled plans for major projects on properties they own.

National developers are recognizing downtown San Jose as a primary, urban market, said Nick Goddard, a vice president with Colliers International, a commercial realty brokerage. Downtown San Jose is no longer a secondary, or tertiary market.

Boston Properties has obtained an option to buy at least a portion of the Platform 16 development site and also has bought a ground lease from TMG and Valley Oak Partners on the property, according to several Santa Clara County public documents. Boston Properties paid $2.8 million in multiple transactions to obtain the ground lease and purchase options, with the most recent one occurring on Jan. 23, the county records show.

A ground lease means TMG and Valley Oak are renting land for the development to Boston Properties, and Boston would own one or more buildings that would be constructed on the site.

Separately, TMG and Valley Oak, acting through an affiliate, have paid $38.2 million to buy the site through a series of transactions, with the most recent one occurring on Jan. 24.

The joint venture of TMG and Valley Oak also has obtained a $30.1 million loan to finance its purchase of the land and existing buildings on the 5.4-acre site, county documents show.

The Boston Properties interest in the site would bring to the project a company with plenty of financial muscle to add to the considerable resources of TMG and Valley Oak Partners. During the one-year period that ended in September, Boston Properties, a real estate investment and development company, earned $527.6 million on revenue of $2.67 billion, according to the Yahoo Finance site.

Boston Properties is one of those developers with ongoing relationships with big tech companies, said Bob Staedler. principal executive with San Jose-based Silicon Valley Synergy, a land use and planning consultancy. Boston Properties getting involved with Platform 16 is more fuel for the fire for downtown San Jose.

TMG and Valley Oak have gained final approvals from the city to build the campus, which would consist primarily of three big modern office buildings. The sellers of the parcels for the campus were trusts controlled by the Michael Akatiff family or an Akatiff company called Pacific Coast Cycle, the county documents show.

Downtown San Jose is a proven commodity, Goddard said.",191,Thy Vo,26-Jan-19,Who Is On The Board Behind The Huge Levi's Stadium Tax Cut?,1127,The East Bay Times (california),,"Who Is On The Board Behind The Huge Levi's Stadium Tax Cut?

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe assessment appeals boards make decisions about some $819 million dollars in potential property tax refunds that would impact public agencies across the county.

SAN JOSE - Until it delivered a $36 million tax windfall to the San Francisco 49ers last week, most people probably never heard of an assessment appeals board.

But as its action showed, the obscure three-member panel wields considerable financial power. It alone can change a county assessor's professional appraisal of the value of residential and commercial property and, consequently, the amount of property taxes that must be paid.

The appeals board is one of three in Santa Clara County whose appointed members can rule whether giant corporations such as Apple and Google have a case when they contest billions of dollars of property taxes that the county assessor determined they owe. And when those companies sway the board to award them hefty refunds, local governments, schools and special districts can stand to lose millions of dollars in local property tax revenue.

That scenario played out Wednesday when one of those boards cut the property tax obligations for Levi's Stadium in half, resulting in a $36 million refund to the 49ers and an annual $6 million reduction in tax revenue for public agencies. Hardest hit by the decision was the Santa Clara Unified School District, which may have to dip into its reserves to pay back $13 million to the team and plan on receiving $2.5 million less each year in tax revenue.

County Assessor Larry Stone, whose office calculated how much the 49ers' should pay in taxes, said he was ""shocked"" by the decision.еКAlthough he has in the past questioned the qualifications of appeals board members, Stone said that wasn't the issue in this case. ""I think the complicated nature of the structure of the transaction is what did it - dozens of interlocking, intricate agreements, totaling thousands of pages, and structured in a complicated way,"" Stone said. ""It took hearing after hearing just to understand the complexity of the transaction.""

Decisions that go against an original assessment are the rare exception rather than the rule, however.

On average, the appeals boards uphold 90 percent of property value that's appealed, said Stone. As of January, property owners haveеКcontested $81.9 billion worth of total assessments in Santa Clara County.

Apple, the county's largest property taxpayer, currently is disputing $10.4 billion and could reap a $104 million tax refund if it prevails, according to the assessor's office.

Statewide, county assessors have the power to determineеКthe value of a property and the taxes that must be paid on it, and taxpayers can appeal those decisions to either the board of supervisors or panels nominated by them. In Santa Clara County, they must take their arguments to one of the three assessment appeals boards. Those boards areеКquasi-judicial bodies and the decisions they make are final; if either the assessor or a property owner is unhappy with a decision, there's no recourse.

Appeals board members are appointed by county supervisors to three-year terms and there's no limit to the number of times they can serve. They must have a minimum of five years professional experience in California as either a certified public accountant or public accountant, licensed real estate broker, attorney, or property appraiser with a nationally recognized professional accreditation.

Assessment Appeals Board I, which heard the Levi's Stadium appeal, has one vacancy after the retirement of Stan Tish, a principal at the San Jose appraisal firm Berliner, Kidder & Tish.еКRichard Labagh, a member of Appeals Board III who was appointed in 2010 and owns Labagh Appraisal & Consulting, filled in for Tish in the Levi's Stadium appeal.

The other two members of the board are Wayne Prescott, an appraiser for the firm Carneghi-Nakasako & Associates, who was appointed in 2010, and William Anderson, a former county attorney appointed in 2006 who provided legal counsel for the housing authority.

Appeals Board II members are Frank Schmidt, also an appraiser at Carneghi-Nakasako who was appointed in 2012, residential realtor John Howe who was appointed in 2010, and residential realtor David Tonna who was appointed in November 2018.

Schmidt appraised properties recently purchased by Google for its downtown San Jose campus, according to his resume.

In addition to Labagh, Appeals Board III's members are Dennis Moredock, an appraiser for the national firm Allstate Appraisal who was appointed in 2011, and Sharon Kreider, a certified public accountant who was appointed in 2010.

With so much money at stake, Stone has occasionally clashed with supervisors over the qualifications of appointees. He argues each board should have a real estate attorney, a certified public accountant and high-level appraiser.

At a Nov. 20 board meeting, Stone opposed Tonna's nomination by Supervisor Dave Cortese to Assessment Appeals Board II. Stone's preferred candidate was Chris Carneghi, owner of the firm Carneghi-Nakasako, which counts public agencies, including the city of San Jose, among its clients.

Tonna, a residential realtor, has held a real estate sales license since 1988 and a broker license since 2004, according to state records. He is the past president of the Silicon Valley Association of Realtors and has two years of college, according to his application.

""The problem is, 95 percent of assessment appeals cases don't involve homes or condos,"" Stone said in explaining his objection to Tonna.

""Data centers, telecom equipment, commercial aircraft, high-tech electronic equipment and machines ... we desperately need members who are experienced in determining the values of these properties,"" Stone said.

The references on Tonna's application include South Bay Labor Council Executive Director Ben Fields, and Howe, a Sunnyvale realtor whose appointment Stone opposed in 2010, citing similar concerns about experience.

At the Nov. 20 meeting, Cortese noted he interviewed both applicants and found them highly qualified.еКHe questioned Stone's role in making recommendations for appointments to a board whose role is to act as an independent check on his decisions.

""I think something's rotten in Denmark,"" Cortese said. ""Some questions have to be asked about where those encouragements and persuasions are coming from. ...are they coming from the very entity that stands to be corrected by the assessment appeals board when they're wrong?""

Supervisor Joe Simitian said the board routinely defers to individual board members when it's their turn to make appointments.

""Candidly, I'm not inclined to second-guess the appointments of my colleagues ... as long as they meet the standards they are required to meet,"" Simitian said.

Stone told the board it should aim for ""the most qualified and experienced person, not the minimum requirements.""

Take a look at our Crane Watch feature, and you'll see a downtown landscape dotted with multiple markers showing proposed projects. It's a map that shows not just the promise of San Jose, but the real belief developers have in making the Bay Area's largest city a destination in its own right.

But you may wonder something after scrolling through Crane Watch and clicking on the icons that designate office, multifamily, hotel or mixed-use projects. Where are all the cranes?

In the two years since I've been in Silicon Valley, only a few of these downtown developments have broken ground. The final piece of River Corporate CenterеКis rising near Little Italy. The Graduate, a residential tower for students, appears to have topped off on South Second Street. In San Pedro Square, the market-rate multifamily Silvery Towers have gotten a glass facade while the Modera is still all wood and concrete.

The most ambitious projects - among them, the twin towers to go where the old Greyhound bus station sits vacant, a 24-story cantilevered addition to the Montgomery Hotel, a trio of office and residential projects at Park and Almaden - have no outward signs of building life. As Janice Bitters, the Business Journal's tenacious commercial real estate reporter, has written about, things are happening behind the scenes. We just can't see them.

That kind of inaction rankles Lew Wolff, the master developer and driving force behind San Jose's last great burst of downtown development nearly three decades ago. Wolff, who is responsible for the Fairmont Hotel and CityView Plaza, offered his take on how San Jose grew and where it's headed during a fascinating event hosted by SPUR San Jose last week.

""I believe the cost of indecision is greater than the cost of making a decision and it frustrates the heck out of me,"" Wolff said, citing bureaucracies in local government and within private businesses as being a big part of the problem. ""Everybody wants to check things out. The world won't come to an end if we make a mistake.""

Big projects are great, Wolff said, but the city can unnecessarily drag out a review process while private developers can sit on a property indefinitely without much of an incentive or penalty for not moving.

еб    Join SVBJ for our Future of Downtown San Jose event on Jan. 31

Name-checking two of the biggest proposals out there - Google's ambitions to create a giant campus near Diridon Station and Adobe's more concrete plan to build a fourth tower downtown - Wolff suggested a different approach: ""We should set a time limit to get it done or to tell them they can't do it. And I think San Jose should be a leader in that.""

Wolff's idea is worth a fuller exploration. Otherwise, if San Jose can't figure out a better way to get shovels into the ground faster, the latest blueprint for downtown's grand development might just end up being nothing more than glossy renderings of what could have been.

To Limit Protection For Activist Workers,1402,The East Bay Times (california),,"Google Urged U.s. To Limit Protection For Activist Workers

HIGHLIGHT:еКFaced with plenty of dissent, Google pushed the National Labor Relations Board to reinstate ban on employees organizing via their workplace emails.

By Josh Eidelson, Hassan Kanu and Mark Bergen | Bloomberg News

Google, whose employees have captured international attention in recent months through high-profile protests of workplace policies, has been quietly urging the U.S. government to narrow legal protection for workers organizing online.

During the Obama administration, the National Labor Relations Board broadened employees' rights to use their workplace email system to organize around issues on the job. In a 2014 case, Purple Communications, the agency restricted companies from punishing employees for using their workplace email systems for activities like circulating petitions or fomenting walkouts, as well as trying to form a union. In filings in May 2017 and November 2018, obtained via Freedom of Information Act request, Alphabet's Google urged the National Labor Relations Board to undo that precedent.

Citing dissents authored by Republican appointees, Google's attorneys wrote that the 2014 standard ""should be overruled"" and a George W. Bush-era precedent-allowing companies to ban organizing on their employee email systems-should be reinstated.

In an emailed statement, a Google spokeswoman said, ""We're not lobbying for changes to any rules."" Rather, she said, Google's claim that the Obama-era protections should be overturned was ""a legal defense that we included as one of many possible defenses"" against meritless claims at the NLRB.

If the Labor Board did what Google wanted, ""it would have a huge chilling effect,"" said Google employee activist Colin McMillen, one of tens of thousands around the world who participated in a November walkout following revelations about the company's handling of alleged sexual misconduct. Google's employee email system played a pivotal role in the organizing for that protest, he said, with more than a thousand workers joining an email list used to plan it. Given that employees are spread around the globe and don't have most co-workers' personal emails, he said, company email is key to facilitating workers' ability to mobilize. McMillen currently works at Google's Cambridge, Massachusetts, office, but said he had quit his job and his last day is next month.

""It demonstrates that Google leadership is not operating in good faith,"" said McMillen. ""They can have a town hall and try to say soothing words and get people to not want to quit, but then if in the background they're not just rejecting carrying out most of the demands of the walkout, but also trying to tamp down our ability to even coordinate and talk to each other about these issues, that's extremely concerning.""

Google has long fostered a culture of employee feedback, allowing open debate in meetings and online forums, where staff have advocated for changes to products and facilities over the company's 20-year history. But the past year has seen an unprecedented wave of concentrated and forceful advocacy from employees, often at direct odds with the positions of management.

After Google was awarded a Pentagon contract for using artificial intelligence to analyze drone footage, thousands of employees signed a petition demanding Google remove itself from ""the business of war,"" nine software engineers refused to work on a security feature that could help the company win more military contracts, and in June the company said it wouldn't renew its Department of Defense deal. An employee introduced a shareholder resolution to tie executive compensation to diversity and inclusion, while others wrote a letter to their chief executive officer decrying the treatment of sub-contracted staff as ""part of a system of institutional racism, sexism, and discrimination.""

On November 1, thousands of Google employees around the world joined a midday walkout urging the company overhaul its handling of sexual misconduct and change its governance, including by adding an employee representative to its board. A week later, CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company would make changes including ending forced arbitration for sexual harassment and assault allegations. ""Even in difficult times, we are encouraged by the commitment of our colleagues to create a better workplace,"" Pichai wrote in an email to employees.

It was three weeks later, without fanfare, and in a case unrelated to the walkout, that Google's attorneys made their latest filing urging the Labor Board undo the 2014 precedent protecting workers' ability to organize.

""In an email to all of Google, Sundar assured us that he and Google's leadership supported the walkout. But the company's requests to the National Labor Relations Board tell a different story,"" organizers of the employee walkout wrote in a statement. ""If these protections are rolled back, Google will be complicit in limiting the rights of working people across the United States, not just us."" They asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.

""Google is one of the most open workplaces in the world,"" the company's spokeswoman said. ""Employees have multiple internal forums to express their views, raise concerns and connect, including thousands of internal communities and tens of thousands of email groups.""

Google's objections to the legal protection for employees organizing via employee email came in filings defending itself against allegations brought by a regional director of the NLRB. In a 2017 complaint, the agency had accused Google of violating federal labor law, including by maintaining workplace policies that infringe on workers' rights and by making threats against employees. The complaint also alleged that Google violated the law in 2015 by issuing a warning to an employee because of comments made via email and on the company forum G+ ""regarding workplace diversity and social justice initiatives, workplace policy viewpoints, and regarding employees' rights to express their opinion on G+.""

The name of the employee who was disciplined is redacted in the documents produced via FOIA. His attorney, Noah Peters, said that the employee declined to comment or to identify himself. Peters said that his client was punished by Google for dissenting from the company's ""very, very left-wing office culture"" and for sticking up for co-workers who didn't conform to the ""tribal"" political correctness there. Chris Baker, an attorney representing another worker whose claims against Google are part of the same NLRB case, declined to comment.

""This case is without merit and we are defending the claim vigorously,"" Google's spokeswoman said.

Google has denied the NLRB's allegations of wrongdoing. In a filing responding to the NLRB, it says the employee it disciplined had committed misconduct which ""interfered with Google's lawful interest in maintaining an inclusive workplace for women and minorities that is free of unlawful bias, discrimination, and harassment."" Google also wrote that the NLRB should reverse some of the legal precedents being used against it, including the Purple Communications standard. It is not uncommon for companies to challenge legal precedents being used in cases against them.

The protection established in Purple Communications is ""pretty fundamental"" given the centrality of email to modern workplace communications, said Wilma Liebman, who chaired the NLRB during Obama's first term. Given Google's rhetoric about ""the free exchange of ideas, and itself as a purveyor of mechanisms for communications,"" she said, ""That's an irony that Google, of all companies, would take such a narrow position.""

The relationship between anti-harassment policies and workplace free expression has been a flashpoint at Google, where a different employee, engineer James Damore, was dismissed in 2017 after publishing a manifesto on an internal company forum criticizing the company's diversity policies. Damore filed a complaint of his own with the NLRB, but an associate general counsel at the Labor Board concluded that while much of Damore's essay was likely protected by law, Google was within its rights to terminate him over other portions of it that were ""so harmful, discriminatory, and disruptive"" as to fall outside the legal protections for collective action at work.",194,Levi Sumagaysay,24-Jan-19,"Google, Other Tech Cafeteria Workers Asked To Sign Mandatory Arbitration",602,The East Bay Times (california),,"Google, Other Tech Cafeteria Workers Asked To Sign Mandatory Arbitration

HIGHLIGHT:еКBon Appetit, which provides food services to Google and other tech companies, distributes agreements to its workers amid Googlers' call to end forced arbitration.

As Google employees urge their company and others to end forced arbitration, the tech giants cafeteria workers are being asked to sign mandatory arbitration agreements.

Bon Appetit Management, a Palo Alto company that provides food services at many tech companies including Google, Oracle, Twitter and Uber, along with universities and museums, asked its workers to sign the agreements last week. A Bon Appetit spokeswoman said Thursday that the company has distributed the agreement widely.

One Google eatery worker who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution said Bon Appetit asked its employees to sign the agreements immediately, prompting some to ask if they could read the documents more closely first. If they dont want to sign the agreements, they were told, they would have to submit statements explaining their reasons, the employee said.

Bon Appetit has used arbitration agreements for a number of years, the company spokeswoman said. The worker who spoke with this news organization has been in food services at Google for the past several years and said this was the first time he and his co-workers have been asked to sign the agreement.

When asked what would happen to workers who refused to sign the agreements, the Bon Appetit spokeswoman said the company will address any questions raised by an employee about the arbitration agreement directly with the employee.

When asked for comment Thursday, a Google spokeswoman pointed out that the company does not directly employ the Bon Appetit workers. She also referred to the companys supplier code of conduct, which among other things asks Google suppliers to embrace non-discrimination, diversity and inclusion, and to forbid sexual harassment and abuse.

Last week, Google employees launched a campaign calling for companies to stop requiringеК employees to accept arbitration.

Arbitration is forced when your employer requires you to sign away your right to go to court at the start of your employment, before any legal dispute arises, the group said during a daylong campaign on social media last Tuesday.

Asked to comment about Bon Appetits move, the group said it was sadly aware that contractors are also forcing their employees to sign away their rights to sue. The groups campaign calls for no forced arbitration for temporary, vendor and contract employees, too.

Google should take the lead in denouncing any supplier that forces arbitration for its employees, said Tanuja Gupta, one of the leaders of Googlers for Ending Forced Arbitration, Wednesday night. This means Google also has to end forced arbitration for its own full-time employees.

After thousands of Google employees around the world walked out in November to protest the way the company handles sexual harassment claims, the tech giant said it would end forced arbitration for individual cases of sexual harassment and assault for full-time employees. The Google campaigners say that change has yet to be reflected in their employee agreements, although Google said last week that it recently modified its offer letters.

Google has leased more than 151,000 square feet of office space in Mountain View in a new building where WeWork had previously been working on hashing out lease terms.

Coworking giant WeWork had been a top contender to take over the four-story building at 620 National Ave. But in late November, Google came on the scene, effectively ending the WeWork negotiations.

""Given the two opportunities that were in front of the owners, the business decision was to go with somebody who was publicly traded and has a long history of good credit,"" Justin Reilly, senior vice president at Colliers International, said in an interview Wednesday.

Reilly, along with Gregg von Thaden of Avison Young represented property owners National Avenue Partners LLC in the lease negotiations. Reilly said he couldn't reveal specifics about the lease agreement.

Representatives from Alphabet Inc.-owned Google confirmed the lease but declined to comment further.

When the search and advertising giant moves into the building, between 755 and 1,000 employees could potentially work in the office, based on the standard calculation of about one employee per 150 to 200 square feet of office space.

The glassy building in Mountain View's East Whisman area has been completed for about a year, but Google will be its first tenant. The building sits about three miles from the Googleplex headquarters, but mere blocks from other buildings Google leases, including the Google Quad Campus.

""It just goes to show Google's commitment to Mountain View,"" Reilly said. ""They continue to grow in those areas.""

Indeed, even as Google continues to scoop up land in both Sunnyvale and San Jose for massive new campuses, the company hasn't shifted its focus away from its hometown.

In November, the company also spent $1 billion on a 12-building, 795,663-square-foot office complex in Mountain View known as Britannia Shoreline Technology Park.

That campus, which is already almost entirely occupied by Google, sits across the street from where the company is building a futuristic 595,000-square-foot canopied office building known as Charleston East. In late November, Google also submitted master plans for the North Bayshore area and a potential development at a 60-acre site it owns in the district known as Shorebird.

Next month, Mountain View's city council will decide whether Google, its largest employer by far, will be allowed to grow significantly more in the coming years. Google has request to build up to 2,600 new homes, 150,000 square feet of community and retail space and 1.175 million square feet of net new office space on the Shorebird site.

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe money spent by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft reflects the industry's souring political fortunes in Washington - and the policy battles still on the horizon.

By Tony Romm | The Washington

Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft spent a combined $64 million to shape U.S. regulations and stave off government scrutiny in 2018, according to ethics reports filed late Tuesday, an uptick in lobbying that reflects the industry's souring political fortunes in Washington - and the policy battles still on the horizon.

The tech sector's most prolific spender was Google: It shelled out more than $21 million last year to lobby Congress, the White House and key federal agencies on issues including online privacy, an analysis of the disclosure reports shows. That marks a new record for the search giant, which spent roughly $18 million in 2017 - more than any other company across all industries - to influence policymakers in the nation's capital.

For some in Silicon Valley, the lobbying blitz followed a series of scandals starting with Facebook's mishandling of its users' private data. The incident incensed lawmakers, who began threatening new regulation of the entire tech industry and eventually forced top executives - including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey - to testify for the first time on Capitol Hill.

That onslaught of oversight isn't likely to dissipate in 2019, experts say. Democrats and Republicans in Congress this year have introduced new proposals that would restrict how companies collect and monetize their users' data, for example, and two committees of lawmakers in the House and Senate have pledged to hold hearings soon. The result could be to return Facebook, Google and other Internet behemoths to the congressional spotlight.

""When you come of age as an industry, as we have, and you make so many things possible, you're also going to be under scrutiny for all of the consequences of that, too,"" said Linda Moore, president of TechNet, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group that represents companies including Apple, Facebook and Google.

The industry's top spenders - Amazon, Google and Microsoft - did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Apple and Facebook declined to comment.

To handle the heightened attention in 2018, Facebook spent more than ever to influence lawmakers, totaling $12.6 million in lobbying over the course of 2018, the federal reports show. Twitter also broke its own annual record, spending more than $1 million for the first time, according to the reports. Along with privacy, the two Web giants faced sustained scrutiny on Capitol Hill in 2018 targeting the algorithms that power popular websites and services - and the industry's efforts to stop the spread of abusive content, including hate speech and misinformation.

Key Democrats, now in control of the House, have pledged to return to those issues this year. For many in the industry, ""the question is, is that the start of a new era where they're up here every year?"" said Daniel Castro, vice president at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech think tank that counts representatives from Google and Microsoft as board members. ""Or is it that it was just a pressure point, that they needed to come up here and answer some serious questions but after that we move on to the regular way of doing business in Washington?""

Amazon spent a record $14 million in lobbying in 2018 in part to address its own privacy woes, its disclosures reflect. Privacy watchdogs, including the American Civil Liberties Union, questioned all year whether Amazon had put in place appropriate safeguards on facial-recognition tools that it sells to law enforcement. The e-commerce giant also grappled with fresh doubts in Congress about the size of its corporate footprint - and whether the company put its rivals at a disadvantage. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)

Unlike some of its counterparts in Silicon Valley, Microsoft managed to avoid the Washington spotlight in 2018. It spent more than $9.5 million to lobby last year, according to its lobbying disclosures. Also managing to avoid the spotlight was Apple, which spent more than $6 million in Washington in 2018, a decrease from the prior year.

Instead, Apple labored intensely behind the scenes - in a campaign led by CEO Tim Cook - to ensure that the Trump administration's trade war with China spared Apple's products from steep tariffs. The campaign largely succeeded, but Cook still told investors in January that the repercussions of the international trade dispute would negatively affect its sales in the most recent quarter.",197,Washington Post,23-Jan-19,Google Fine Signals Europe Is Prepared To Take On Silicon Valley,874,The Mercury News (california),,"Google Fine Signals Europe Is Prepared To Take On Silicon Valley

HIGHLIGHT:еКFrench regulators' decision to fine Google almost $57 million for violating the General Data Protection Regulation shows that the European Union is serious about coming after U.S. tech giants.

By Cat Zakrzewski | The Washington Post

French regulators decision to fine Google almost $57 million for violating the General Data Protection Regulation shows that the European Union is serious about coming after U.S. tech giants.

My colleague Tony Romm reported that yesterdays fine is the first major penalty brought against a U.S. technology company for a violation of Europes data privacy regime that took effect in May 2018. Frances top privacy agency, known as CNIL, said Google ran afoul of the new rules when the company failed to properly disclose how users data was collected and did not obtain proper consent for personalized advertising.

This kind of tough enforcement of GDPR positions the European Union to set the bar on privacy globally. The ruling highlights the stark contrast between Europes strong new privacy regime and the absence of a federal privacy law in the United States - and aggressive enforcement could intensify calls among consumer advocates in the United States to grant Americans similarly robust privacy protections. Either way, the privacy crackdown means more pain for Silicon Valley.

The French fine could be the first of many European fines against American technology companies: The privacy activists who brought this GDPR complaint against Google have also filed complaints against Facebook and its subsidiaries Instagram and WhatsApp in other E.U. countries.

Estelle MassМ©, a data protection expert at the advocacy group Access Now, told my colleague James McAuley in Paris that the French ruling is the first big signal that Europe is willing to enforce GDPR. Other U.S. tech giants have engaged in similar practices, she said, creating the possibility that they may face their own fines. Many technology companies have lengthy and complicated privacy policies that critics say fall short of explaining to consumers how their data is being used.

Google is not the only one doing this, MassМ© said. This is significant for Google as a company but also for other actors.

David Heinemeier Hansson, the chief technology officer of the software firm Basecamp, tweeted that the ruling underscores that GDPR could challenge any technology company whose business model heavily relies on ad targeting:

He tweeted If GDPR is actually going to be enforce like this going forward, and its not just a one-off French expedition, the entire business model of Google and Facebook as it pertains to using personal information for ad targeting is in doubt. ABOUT BLOODY TIME! Whats striking about this judgement is just how plainly the violations are detailed, and how clear it is that Google is not going to weasel out of compliance by evading informed consent by its normal tactics of obfuscation. This is a potential game changer for online privacy.

There are other ways the E.U. is clamping down on U.S. technology giants. One of the toughest opponents of Silicon Valleys growing power has been the E.U.s top competition cop, Margarethe Vestager. Shes levied a record-setting antitrust fine against Google and scrutinized Apple and Facebook. The Associated Press reported that though her term ends this fall, shes exploring ways to ensure regulation of U.S. technology companies continues after she leaves office. She is planning a new report to direct the E.U.s competition policies in the digital era.

With this backdrop, many consumer advocates are wondering why the Federal Trade Commission - the United States top privacy and competition watchdog - hasnt taken more action against technology giants.

Jeff Chester, the executive director of the Washington-based privacy advocacy nonprofit group Center for Digital Democracy, said that his organization and other groups have urged the FTC to examine Google for the same problems that the French regulator just addressed in its fine.

Our FTC has had years to act - and there has been nothing done, Chester said in an email. Yet it only took the French privacy regulator a handful of months to decisively protect the public.

As Congress plans to take on national privacy legislation this year, one of the key issues it will grapple with is whether the 104-year-old FTC is well equipped and has the resources to take on Silicon Valley behemoths. Several of the privacy bills that have been floated by Democrats include provisions to give the FTC greater authority and resources to address suspect data collection practices.

Consumer advocates and policymakers alike will be closely watching the outcome of an FTC investigation into Facebook in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica incident, in which the political consulting firm tied to Donald Trumps campaign obtained Facebook users data without their consent. The Washington Posts Tony Romm and Elizabeth Dwoskin reported on last week that the agency is considering bringing a record-breaking fine against the social network.

But as The Posts Geoffrey Fowler noted, even a record-breaking fine could have little impact on the tech giant.",198,States News Service,23-Jan-19,Breaking Down Plastic Waste: On A Winning Streak,454,States News Service,,"Breaking Down Plastic Waste: On A Winning Streak

HIGHLIGHT:еК'One of the most important blocks in all of downtown,' it's deemed essential to the area's revival and expansion.

SAN JOSE  The owner of a property thats deemed essential to the revival and expansion of downtown San Jose has landed a hefty loan, a move that could help spur redevelopment or upgrades of the site.

CityViewеКPlaza, a huge office, restaurant and retail complex in downtown San Jose, was bought in July for $283.5 million  in cash  by an affiliate of developer Jay Paul.

Now San Francisco-based Jay Paul, through the affiliate, has obtained a $157.4 million mortgage from Citibank, according to Santa Clara County property documents.

Jay Paul doesnt do anything by small measures, said Bob Staedler, principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a land use and planning consultancy. He is going to do something big with CityView Plaza.

The 580,000-square-foot site is bounded by West San Fernando Street, South Almaden Boulevard, Park Avenue and South Market Street, and consists of 534,000 square feet of offices and 46,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space.

This is a great site, said Scott Knies, executive director of the San Jose Downtown Association. There is an incredible opportunity to redevelop this property.

A revived CityView Plaza complex could help connect the respective sites of a future Google transit village near the Diridon train station, as well as the proposed expansion of the Adobe headquarters office campus, with the existing primary main parts of downtown San Jose.

This is one of the most important blocks in all of downtown, Knies said. You have major north-south connections, east-west connections.

San Pedro Square, a hive of nightlife, entertainment, restaurants and bars; the hotel districts near the Fairmont and Hilton hotels; and the cultural hubs of the Tech Museum and Center for Performing Arts are all a short distance from CityView Plaza.

Jay Paul has already alerted a number ofеКtenants that some leases in CityView Plaza еКwont be renewed, according to this news organizations review of some of the tenancies at CityView Plaza.

If tenants gradually depart, the cash from the loan could help replace the diminished rental revenue. Or, Jay Paul could use some of the funds to begin to re-position the property. Jay Paul didnt respond to requests for a comment about its intentions for the site.

If Jay PaulеКеКchooses to re-sculpt CityView Plaza as a modern and updated campus with state-of-the-art office buildings, other companies could locate downtown.

Among the major clients of Jay Paul in locales such as Sunnyvale: Facebook, Amazon and Google. Facebook realty executives toured the CityView site with Jay Paul executives at some point during the latter half of 2018, according to multiple sources familiar with the CityView situation.

However, creation of a modern tech campus would require that one or more large existing buildings at CityView Plaza be bulldozed.

Jay Paul is now armed with more cash and he can keep the momentum going on CityView, which is a great project for the downtown, Staedler said.

One thing is certain: The stakes are huge for this vital site, experts say.

If CityView Plaza is brought up to current market conditions, it really is a chance for the middle of downtown San Jose to change tremendously, Knies said.",200,,19-Jan-19,Bart Construction Beginning In Downtown San Jose,388,Real Estate Monitor Worldwide,,"Bart Construction Beginning In Downtown San Jose

Let the construction noise and traffic jams begin.

Early next week, initial construction will begin on bringing BART to downtown San Jose.

According to a construction notice, the work will begin along Santa Clara Street between S. Market Street and N. 3rd Street the week of Jan. 21 and last up to seven weeks.

Plans arent even complete yet and the actual stations arent expected to open until 2026 or so, but the Valley Transportation Authority, which is overseeing the project, needs geotechnical and utility data to flesh out its final design.

According to the notice, crews will be boring into the ground in parking spaces, the sidewalks and on the road. While at least one lane of traffic will be open during the work, residents and workers in the area can expect some delays. The drilling is expected to be about the same noise level as a lawn mower.

Major construction isnt expected downtown until 2020.

In the future, four new stations will extend BART into north San Jose, through downtown and into Santa Clara.

I dont think it will make much of a difference, said Adolfo Perez, whose family opened the new restaurant Claudias Pastes on Santa Clara Street a couple of months ago, of the construction phase.

The savory and sweet pastry shop doesnt have any parking out front right now, anyway, Perez said, so the work likely wont affect his business.

But Perez said hes excited about the possibility of more foot traffic  and more customers  once BART is up and running downtown.

Its definitely great for commuters, he said. Theres tons of public transportation around here.

The expansion of BART to San Jose, along with Googles plans to build a massive campus near Diridon Station, could transform the core of the nations 10th largest city.

Already, the tech giants project has launched a building boom downtown, with developers proposing new office space, stores, houses and hotels.

For now, all the projects mean lots of construction, already evidenced by the spate of cranes dotting San Joses skyline. If everything goes according to plan, Google could break ground on their campus a few years before the BART expansion is done, around 2022, with construction lasting until 2035 or so. Separately, a redesign of Diridon Station is in the works, with connections to high-speed rail a possibility for the future. 2019 Global Data Point.",201,,17-Jan-19,Football: St. Joe's Heading West For Opener,534,"Pascack Valley Community Life (bergen, North Jersey)",Better Living; Pg.

The Green Knights are going back to Cali.

St. Joseph head football coach Augie Hoffmann confirmed the news  Friday that his team would open the 2018 season by taking part in  the Honor Bowl in California, a series of games that honor the U.S.  Military.

Hoffmann's squad, which finished No. 1 in the USA TODAY NETWORK New  Jersey state poll, will face JSerra Catholic Saturday, Aug. 31 at 4  p.m. at Cathedral Catholic High School in San Diego.

It will mark the Green Knights' second trip to California and  second time participating in the Honor Bowl. In 2016, the Green  Knights opened the season against Juniperro Serra (not the same  school) with a 17-7 win in Mission Viejo, California. Google Maps  lists the trip as 2,843 miles from the Montvale campus to Cathedral  Catholic.

""I stayed close with the guy who runs the event since we went out  there and he asked if I wanted to get back into it that he may have  a great opponent for us,"" said Hoffmann. ""I spoke to our  administration, told them how positive it was for us the last time  and they agreed.""

JSerra Catholic finished 9-3 last season, losing in the  quarterfinals of the CIF Southern Section Division 1 playoffs and  finished third in the Trinity League. They will return running back  Christopher Street, who has offers from Florida, Oregon and San  Jose State. The Lions finished 17th in the nation in the MaxPreps  national poll.

In North Jersey, St. Joe's finished 10-2, winning the Non-Public  Group 4 state title with a 13-0 win over Bergen Catholic.

Hoffmann said the final arrangements aren't set, but tentatively  that the Green Knights would like to leave that Thursday. The Honor  Bowl has a series of events for the players to take part in before  the game. Hoffmann said in 2016, the team toured Camp Pendleton and  spent time learning what it was like to be in the military.

""I think its good for the boys to see that stuff and it's good to  get a reality check and see what goes on in this world,"" said  Hoffmann. ""It's just awesome. They think they work hard and that  football is tough - and it is - but you're talking about another  level of commitment here.""

St. Joe's will return starting quarterback Mike Alaimo and  offensive tackle Luke Wypler who has committed to Ohio State.  Defensive end Smith Vilbert just picked up an offer from Florida  State, and listed his top four as Penn State, Oregon, Syracuse and  Florida.

Hoffmann said the Green Knights schedule isn't official, but that  the team will face Imhotep Charter (Pa.) the following week, and  that there are discussions underway for a possible game at MetLife  Stadium in Week 2. (Technically, the JSerra game is Week 0 in the  New Jersey calendar).

The Green Knights opened the 2018 season in Georgia, losing to  American Heritage of Florida on a last-second field goal. Hoffmann  was suspended for that game by the New Jersey State Interscholastic  Athletic Association and had to stay back in the team hotel, but he  should be good to go for 2019.

""I think I made it through unscathed,"" said Hoffmann laughing. ""I  will be there.""

USA TODAY NETWORK - N.J.",202,Lenny Siegel And Pat Burt,17-Jan-19,Former Mountain View And Palo Alto Mayors: New Business Taxes Won't Hurt Jobs;,823,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Former Mountain View And Palo Alto Mayors: New Business Taxes Won't Hurt Jobs;

Editor's note: A guest column last week from Carl Guardino, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, criticized recent successful efforts of localities imposing new taxes on businesses. To Guardino, these measures could hurt job growth in the region. In rebuttal, two former mayors - Mountain View's Lenny Siegel and Palo Alto's Pat Burt - say the taxes are reasonable and responsible.

Under Carl Guardino's leadership, the Silicon Valley Leadership Group has constructively represented the interests of the region's largest employers on issues such as housing, climate change, education and immigration. However, the Leadership Group's consistent position on government revenues is, to say the least, regressive. It supports taxes that disproportionately fall on residents with modest incomes. For all of its big tech affluence, Silicon Valley remains a region with exceptionally low business taxes.

The biggest obstacle to job growth and economic sustainability in Silicon Valley is not local taxes on big tech business, but the difficulty companies have attracting and retaining workers. And that is caused by the failure of housing and transportation to keep up with massive high-tech employment growth. In November, 71 percent of Mountain View voters passed Measure P - an increase in the business tax based on the number of employees - not only to provide funds for several specific transportation projects, but for the city to initiate projects in a county where the transit agency - VTA - consistently invests in transit designed to promote growth in downtown San Jose, instead of easing traffic on existing commute routes.

The job-rich cities of Silicon Valley are working with employers to figure out better ways to get people to work. Mountain View is working on a reversible bus lane, new freeway off-ramp and street realignments to make it easier for employees to get to North Bayshore, the site of Google's main campus, and it is studying an elevated automated guideway connecting North Bayshore to the Caltrain station on Evelyn Avenue.

Mountain View could have chosen to devote even more of its employer tax to housing or other measures to sustain its livability. Silicon Valley's success depends on attracting bright people from all over the world who need the parks, schools and neighborhoods where folks want to live.

When fully implemented in three years, Mountain View's so-called ""Google tax"" will remain less than .0725 percent of Google's median salary (which is a fraction of their local payroll premium). And because of its progressive structure, the tax has low rates for service employers and startups. Indeed, it could be much higher and still not discourage hiring.

In San Francisco - another of the cities where voters approved new taxes on big businesses last November, specifically to deal with tackling that city's homeless problem - business taxes are much higher than anywhere in Silicon Valley. There, companies pay more than $2,000 per high-tech employee in taxes. Compare that with Mountain View, where Google will pay $143 per employee when the tax fully takes effect in three years.

And polling shows the public sees big businesses as a contributing factor to the region's problems. For example, one survey from last year found 48 percent of respondents said that high-tech job growth was a major contributor to the housing crisis. Employers profit from growth, but their neighbors with less income pay for it in more traffic and unaffordable housing. It is the responsibility of local government to manage sustainable growth and provide needed services by investing in infrastructure and programs that benefit both employers and the community at large.

Guardino began his Jan. 11 column in the Business Journal by reminding us of the job losses of the dot-com bust and the Great Recession. If anything, the dot-com boom/bust was a lesson in the need for more rational and balanced growth rather than proof that irrationally exuberant job growth is healthy. While the dynamics of business cycles will continue, employer taxes are no more than blips against the economic backdrop of larger economic forces.

Silicon Valley has what may be the greatest concentration of wealth in human history, with major companies valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet our low- and middle-income residents are being pushed out of their homes, people are living on the streets or in vehicles, and others are enduring long commutes from less expensive housing.

Given that wealth, why does the Leadership Group consistently promote sales tax increases and bridge tolls that burden the little guy? Progressive employer taxes are designed to meet communities' real needs by charging those who can afford to pay and who benefit most from growth.

HIGHLIGHT:еКOver the last two years, since the outset of 2017 when Google's downtown plans became known to realty and political insiders, new building proposals have poured into San Jose City Hall, construction projects have sprouted on the skyline, and investors have unleashed a shopping spree for choice parcels, although the tech titan is deemed to be one key factor among several.

SAN JOSE - Even before Google has begun construction on its proposed massive transit village in San Jose, the search giant's property purchases have helped catalyze a frenzy of development plans that could dramatically reshape the city's downtown.

Most striking is the dramatic surge in proposed downtown San Jose office space: from no new office development proposed in 2016 - before Google began snapping up properties for its project - to more than 1 million square feet proposed in 2017, and another 4.3 million square feet proposed in 2018, according to a survey of city planning documentsеК through mid-December by this news organization.

With all those new workers potentially heading downtown - Google's project alone calls for up to 20,000 employees - housing and retail proposals have blossomed.

Younger tech employees' shifting attitudes about where they want to work and live appears to be adding some momentum to downtown's development.

""Maybe the tide is finally changing,"" said Jerry Strangis, principal executive with Strangis Properties. ""Maybe that kind of workforce that has been missing downtown is finally here. The millennial generation of 20-somethings wants to experience and enjoy a downtown scene and an urban setting.""

Developers often refer to the real estate impact from Google's plan as ""the Google effect."" But while the technology giant is a key factor behind the surge in activity, there are other ingredients fueling the boom, including plans for more transit links, pro-development policies, rising property values and Bay Area job growth.

""Google is very helpful, but they are only part of the story,"" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said. ""We have had decades of policies designed to build more transit, develop more high-density residential, more office buildings, more restaurants, more amenities in downtown San Jose.""

Diridon Station - already a hub for light rail, Caltrain, Amtrak, the Capitol Corridor line and the ACE Train - is poised to become a future Bay Area Rapid Transit station.

""If downtown San Jose were a living organism, the transit system is the skeleton,"" said Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which has pushed for numerous transit financing measures for the Bay Area and the South Bay. ""The muscles will be the jobs coming downtown.""

Rising property values for offices, housing and hotels have also made development projects more attractive, while federal tax cuts have spurred business investments.

After Google's transit village plan was announced, Adobe Systems, the first major tech company to place its headquarters in downtown San Jose, announced it has decided to ""double down"" on the downtownеКby adding a fourth office tower to its campus on the banks of the Guadalupe River.

""As an early pioneer to downtown San Jose, we continue to see opportunity for innovation and investment in the area,"" said Jonathan Francom, an Adobe vice president  employee and workplace solutions. ""We will be expanding in downtown San Jose, which will provide capacity to roughly double our current headquarter employee population.""

Property buyers also have jumped into the fray. Over the 12 months that ended in September, tech companies and realty investors mounted a $1.43 billion shopping spree for downtown properties,еКfar outpacing the $484 million buyers spent on downtown properties over the prior one-year period that ended in September 2017.

""My family has been downtown forever, and this is the strongest I've ever seen it,"" said John DiNapoli,еКpresident of J.P. DiNapoli, a veteran development firm. ""This is the most activity I've seen.""

The cascade of interest suggests that downtown San Jose could finally be on the verge of a transformation that could landеКthe city some of the Silicon Valley mojo that has brought jobs and wealth to neighboring cities such as Mountain View, Palo Alto and San Francisco.

""The economic upturns in the Bay Area bypassed downtown San Jose,"" said Bob Staedler, principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a land-use and planning consultancy. ""Downtown has always needed a push. Google is providing that push, is causing more velocity, and making more people look at the downtown.""

The development rush is happening as Google plans forеК6 million to 8 million square feet of office space, retail and housing on a 240-acre site near the Diridon Station. Google, directly or through an investment partnership, has bought 51 parcels, paying a combined $310.1 million and now owns a swath of land stretching from north of the SAP Center southward to an old Orchard Supply Hardware store near Interstate 280.

""The amount of money and investment pouring into the downtown is the highest it's ever been. It's at an insane level,"" said Nick Goddard, a vice president with the Colliers International commercial real estate firm. ""Companies like Google and Adobe are looking at their long-term growth. They realize that traffic is only going to get worse. So they want to move staff up and down the Caltrain line, and eventually up and down the BART line.""

As office plans have multiplied, housing proposals for the area have also surged, from 954 residential units proposed in 2016 to 3,848 units in 2018. Downtown retail-development plans have soared too, from 6,900 square feet in 2016 to 101,000 square feet in 2018.

Museum Place - a mixed-use project of offices, hotel rooms, housing and an expansion of the Tech Museum of Innovation -еКhas been revived with a fresh investment led by Gary Dillabough, who has also made a splash with plans for a high-profile renovation of the landmark Bank of Italy building and upgrades of other older buildings downtown.

""We have the Google effect on the west side of the downtown and the Dillabough effect on the east side,"" said Mark Ritchie, president of the San Jose-based Ritchie Commercial realty firm.

TheеКchanges can unleash far-reaching transformations in an office market like downtown San Jose because it is so compact, Ritchie said.еКBrokerage companies estimate that downtown San Jose's office market totals 10 million square feet compared to Oakland, which has about 14 million square feet of office space, or downtown San Francisco withеК72 million square feet.

""When change happens in a downtown as small as San Jose's it will be felt much more greatly and more quickly,"" Ritchie said.

Some small-business executives downtown welcome the changes, such as Joe Horrigan, general manager of San Pedro Square Market.

""I think the Google project is great for downtown,"" Horrigan said. ""I go to Mountain View for the movies, and Google has created a lot of walkable places around its headquarters. The same thing can happen here with the train station. San Pedro Square continues to grow. You have all of these residential projects like Silvery Towers right behind us. You have Google, Amazon, Adobe all expanding here.""

Dillabough, however, has some reservations.

""It's almost as if the hype over Google is driving too much speculation in the marketplace,"" Dillabough said. ""We are actually starting to back away from some properties. Owners have gotten too enthusiastic about what they can sell their buildings for.""

To be sure, the success - or even construction - of these downtown projects is far from certain. A job slump or a cooling commercial real estate market could hobble new development activity.

Already, the boom in property values has alarmed Silicon Valley Rising, a coalition of community groups. The organization is pressuring Google and San Jose city leaders to ensure that Google's planned expansion will benefit middle- and low-income workers, notеК displace them.

""The Google project would affect the entire city of San Jose,"" said Ben Field, executive officer of the South Bay Labor Council, which is part of Silicon Valley Rising. ""The community wants Google to come to downtown San Jose, but only if they provide the community benefits to prevent people from being evicted and becoming homeless.""",206,George Avalos,10-Jan-19,Google Campus Starts To Take Shape In North San Jose,514,The East Bay Times (california),,"Google Campus Starts To Take Shape In North San Jose

HIGHLIGHT:еКIn a huge industrial building that Google bought in north San Jose, the search giant intends to place some operations of its Google Hardware unit -- formerly known as Nest -- according to a building permit application on file with city officials.

SAN JOSE  Google appears to be taking fresh steps towards what could be a new campus for the search giant in north San Jose, where the company spent nearly $272 million buying five buildings during 2018.

In a huge industrial building that Google bought, the search giant intends to place some operations of its Google Hardware unit  formerly known as Nest according to a planning permit application on file with the city of San Jose.

Mountain View-based Google has confirmed the plans for the building. The brand-new industrial building is at 5093 Disk Drive and is about 168,000 square feet in size, according to a listing on Loopnet.

At this time we plan for our Hardware team to use the building, Google said in an email to this news organization regarding the application and the occupancy for the building.

This building is one of three big and new industrial buildings that Google bought in January 2018, paying $117.3 million. All three buildings are on Disk Drive in north San Jose, just north of State Route 237.

In October 2018, Google paid $154.5 million for two big office buildings on North First Street. The 4400 N. First St. office building is empty and the 4300 N. First St. building is leased to Harmonic, although that lease expires in 2020.

Google is definitely a company that has a lot of irons in the fire, said David Vanoncini, a managing partner with the San Jose office of Kidder Mathews, a commercial realty brokerage. They seem to be working on projects in almost every type of business you can imagine.

Although not directly connected, the clusters of office and industrial buildings are about a two-minute drive, or a brisk walk, from each other, when traveling along Disk Drive, which links the five buildings. Some smaller parcels and buildings are situated in-between. Were Google to purchase the properties adjacent to what it already owns, it would control a huge and contiguous area.

Google doesnt intend to immediately move into the Disk Drive building where the interior construction is being planned.

We wont begin use until the end of this year at the earliest, Google said in the email.

Because all five buildings are north of 237, they are actually fairly close to sections of Sunnyvale and Mountain View where Google has been busy buying dozens of properties and launching construction in some cases. They also are not all that far from the companys Googleplex headquarters in Mountain View.

The three office buildings total 377,000 square feet, enough room for 1,800 to 2,000 employees of Google or its owner, Alphabet. The industrial buildings total 563,000 square feet.

In downtown San Jose, near the Diridon train station, Google plans a development where 25,000 people could work, including 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giants employees, in a transit-oriented community of office buildings, homes, hotels, shops, restaurants and open spaces.

The fact that Google is broadening out into San Jose, along with the development in downtown San Jose that they are considering, all of this is great for the region as far as employment goes, Vanoncini said.",207,Roland Li,10-Jan-19,Google Expands Again With Tower Deal;,518,The San Francisco Chronicle (california),Business; Pg. Dc1,"Google Expands Again With Tower Deal;

Google's search results have led to even more San Francisco real estate.

The tech giant leased 190,000 square feet - room for more than 1,200 employees based on typical occupancy standards - at One Maritime Plaza in the north Financial District, the company confirmed this week. Google signed the deal in December, its third San Francisco office expansion of 2018, and employees will start moving into the tower in 2020. Google did not specify how many employees will work there.

In November, Google leased 300,000 square feet at Salesforce's former headquarters at the Landmark at One Market building, one of the year's biggest deals. It also signed a 57,299-square-foot expansion at 2 Harrison St., its longtime office in San Francisco.

The three deals boost Google's San Francisco offices to 1.5 million square feet, making it the third-largest tech tenant behind only Salesforce and Uber, according to real estate brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield. Google has even more space in Silicon Valley - more than 19 million square feet, with major long-term expansion plans near its Mountain View headquarters and in San Jose.

Google and other tech giants like Facebook and Amazon have shown seemingly bottomless appetites for new offices, both in the Bay Area and around the country.

Google said this week it is leasing 584,000 square feet at the Westside Pavilion in Los Angeles, a former shopping mall being converted into offices. It also has a $1 billion office expansion planned in New York, on the heels of its $2.4 billion acquisition of Chelsea Market last year.

""Big tech continues to expand and will be the primary economic driver here and in every other major market - San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City and on and on,"" said Robert Sammons, a research director at Cushman & Wakefield.

""The shaky public markets and the trade war have yet to stop those with deep pockets. Big tech seems to essentially be in it for the long haul and needs to follow the talent,"" Sammons said.

In a sign of the times, Google will occupy around a third of the 25-story One Maritime Plaza, located at 300 Clay St., as non-tech tenants are leaving.

Del Monte Foods said in 2015 it was leaving San Francisco, where it was founded in 1886, for Walnut Creek - joining a corporate exodus from the city of companies like McKesson and Bechtel. The decision came six years after Del Monte Foods leased space at One Maritime Plaza for a new headquarters.

The J.M. Smucker Co. said last year it was closing its One Maritime Plaza office, laying off 100 employees and consolidating workers in its Ohio headquarters. Private equity firm Hellman & Friedman is also leaving the high-rise after leasing a new office at Salesforce Tower.

Other tenants at One Maritime Plaza include billionaire Tom Steyer's Farallon Capital Management, Osterweis Capital Management LLC, and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill - the large architecture firm that also designed the dark glass and aluminum tower in 1967.

A Morgan Stanley investment fund bought One Maritime Plaza in 2007 as part of a massive $2.5 billion portfolio deal for 10 San Francisco skyscrapers.",208,Roland Li,8-Jan-19,Google Campus Could Transform San Jose S Core;,1328,The San Francisco Chronicle (california),Business; Pg.

For decades, canneries around San Jose's Diridon Station processed the fruits of the fertile ""Valley of Heart's Delight,"" now known as Silicon Valley. Opened in 1935, what was then called Cahill Depot was a rail depot for the Southern Pacific Railroad.

The canneries were demolished, as fruit orchards faded away and were replaced by low-slung tech offices. Parking lots now dot quiet streets on the western edge of downtown.

Transportation could once again usher in San Jose's future, this time in partnership with a 21st century corporate giant. Google, Silicon Valley's biggest tech tenant, wants to build a mammoth campus in the area over the next two decades, coinciding with the BART extension to Diridon Station planned for 2026 and future high-speed rail. The station already has Amtrak, Caltrain and light rail.

With 6 million to 8 million square feet of commercial space planned, 20,000 employees from Google and other companies could work in the area. That would boost downtown San Jose's job base of 43,000 by almost 50 percent, according to city data. Google could become the city's largest private employer, surpassing Cisco Systems' 9,800 current workers.

Diridon Station plans will differ from many existing tech campuses that are isolated from the public and steer workers to private cafeterias, shops and gyms. Google plans to include housing, parks and shops open to everyone - though neighbors fear the company's arrival will push them out.

Google has positioned the expansion as having broad community benefits.

""We've heard first and foremost that we need to prioritize housing at varying levels of affordability, and we're committed to doing so,"" said Mark Golan, Google vice president of real estate, at a City Council hearing last month.

San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo supports the expansion. He said Google will bring ""a tech corporate campus that's not built with guarded walls and a moat with alligators with it, but actually a campus that's integrated with a public urban village.""

Liccardo said it would also help reverse decades of suburban sprawl, fueled by congested highways that slice through downtown San Jose.

Diridon Station's ridership is expected to grow eightfold - from 17,600 daily passengers in 2016 to 140,000 passengers in 2040 - according to the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority.

""San Jose, of course, sprawled during the age of the automobile. Our development pattern was really something resembling a doughnut"" - growing outskirts and an overlooked downtown, Liccardo said. ""This is an opportunity for us to really retrofit a city really built for the automobile for a city built for people.""

Flight traffic from Mineta San Jose International Airport has capped building heights to around a dozen stories. Liccardo said the city plans to propose height increases this month.

Google is not seeking tax subsidies for the expansion and plans to pay for unspecified community benefits around affordable housing, homeless aid, education and job training. That compares favorably with other tech deals, said Liccardo, citing Amazon expansions that call for billions of dollars in public subsidies from New York and Virginia.

A poll last year by the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a business-backed nonprofit whose members include Google, found that 68 percent of likely voters support the expansion.

But critics fear Google will make San Jose, which already has some of the highest housing costs in the country, more of a place that only the rich can afford.

About 50 local activists have organized against the project. ""The impacts will negatively affect our neighborhood,"" said Liz Gonzalez, 38, a lifelong San Jose resident who works near Diridon Station. ""A tech company's only going to drive up prices.""

She would rather see no tech offices and a community-driven land trust plan with parks and affordable housing.

Gonzalez was one of eight people arrested at a 10-hour City Council meeting last month after they chained themselves to chairs and chanted against the project.

Despite the opposition, the council voted unanimously to sell public land to Google for $110 million, citing the long-term boost of millions of dollars in expected tax benefits.

Liccardo says the housing crisis goes beyond Google. In 2017, he called for 25,000 new homes by 2022 - before the first new Google office is expected to open.

Within the Diridon Station area, about 5,000 housing units could be built, a city study found. The city has a goal of 25 percent affordable housing there.

Aggressive land annexation has made San Jose the Bay Area's largest and most populated city, sprawling across 180 square miles. It's the 10th largest by population in the United States, with more than 1 million residents.

Despite being the headquarters to a number of household tech names, including PayPal, eBay and Adobe, it's more of a bedroom community than a jobs center, city officials say.

More than 60 percent of employed residents leave San Jose for smaller jobs-rich cities like Mountain View and Palo Alto, worsening commutes and depriving San Jose of tax revenue.

The region's three largest tech companies - Apple, Facebook and Google - have headquarters elsewhere. And the next crop of major employers - including Twitter, Uber and Airbnb - chose San Francisco for their headquarters.

""It's a different generation of tech companies. They want to be in an exciting, urban place. San Jose hasn't gotten there yet,"" said Terry Christensen, professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University. ""The population here has really been focused on work and family.""

No new office buildings are under construction downtown because asking rents aren't high enough to justify the cost of construction, said Erik Hallgrimson, a broker with Cushman and Wakefield. That in turn limits job growth.

Final approval of Google's expansion isn't expected until 2021 at the earliest, and the next two years will be a marathon of public hearings, City Council votes, environmental studies - and continued opposition.

Martha Nieves, a lifelong San Jose resident, lives in Cinnabar Commons, an affordable housing complex two blocks away from the Google site. She makes $15.75 per hour at Hope Services working with autistic children.

As a single mom raising two kids, the city's high living costs are already a challenge. She fears Google's arrival will make it even harder.

""I do not want to move to the east side. I'm going to try my best to stay,"" she said. ""I feel that a lot of people are scared.""

Nieves thinks Google has been too vague about its community benefits plans and thinks future jobs will largely benefit people who don't currently live in San Jose.

Golan, the Google executive leading the project, said at last month's public hearing that the company chose to get community feedback before proposing a project. He said the company has held over 30 meetings with neighbors and will continue to talk with them. A Google spokeswoman did not make Golan available for comment, referring instead to his past public comments.

Nieves hopes to see more commitment to blue-collar jobs and a large amount of affordable housing. ""I think there's an agreement we can all come to,"" she said. ""There's always a middle ground for everything.""

Other critics have said San Jose's talks with Google have been too secretive, and two nonprofits sued the city in November claiming the city entered into illegal nondisclosure agreements. City officials have said the nondisclosure agreements are typical when land deals are being discussed, and they no longer apply.

Liccardo said that rejecting Google would be the wrong choice, because the company would expand instead in neighboring cities. That would still increase housing demand in San Jose and deny the city any fiscal upside, he said.

""We get all the pain and none of the benefit,"" he said.

Neighbor turning against neighbor. Name-calling. Pro-development versus slow-growth, and NIMBY versus YIMBY.

Welcome to the new hotbed of the Bay Area's raging housing debate: locally grown social networking site Nextdoor.

From Cupertino, where controversial plans are underway to turn Vallco Mall into a massive housing, office and shopping complex; to San Jose, where a proposed Google campus could bring more than 25,000 new jobs as the region struggles with a housing shortage; to Oakland, where homeless encampments sprawl against a backdrop of new high-rise apartments, residents are arguing passionately on Nextdoor about the future of their communities and the region as a whole. The intense debates that start on the social media plat

form are making their way to city hall, fueling real-life protests, petitions and ballot referendums, and even influencing local elections.

""It shapes people's opinion,"" Foster City Mayor Sam Hindi said. ""It creates a lot of pressure and influence on policymakers.""

Nextdoor has expanded the Bay Area housing debate, opening the conversation to residents who don't have the time or inclination to attend council meetings, and allowing community organizing with the click of a mouse. Neighbors trade their visions for pending developments and debate high-level solutions to the Bay Area's housing crisis, often alongside their mayors or city council members. Others organize groups for political action. But sometimes opinionated residents clash, leading to angry online confrontations.

""Unfortunately Nextdoor has not worked out to be ... a very satisfactory tool either for people who are pro-housing or people who want to set up a breather from housing,"" said Bob Cushman, a leader of slow-growth group Foster City Residents for Responsible Development, who was active on Nextdoor until he was kicked off several months ago over accusations he was using the site to campaign. ""It's not monitored very well. It's turned into a very toxic kind of site.""

San Francisco-based Nextdoor launched in 2011, promising that ""when neighbors start talking, good things happen."" The platform groups users into neighborhoods, and members post about everything from lost pets to babysitters to garage sales to break-ins on the website and mobile app. Users must prove their home address in order to join a neighborhood - of which there are 210,000, spanning eight countries - and they can't see posts outside their own geographic area.

Like other social media sites, Nextdoor struggles to walk the line between allowing users to post freely and policing for content that violates the platform's rules. The site prohibits attacking or insulting fellow neighbors, public shaming, political campaigning and other behaviors, and users can flag offensive posts for possible removal.

The housing debate is exactly the type of conversation Nextdoor wants on its platform, because it's the epitome of a hyperlocal issue, said company spokesman Steve Wymer. But it's also an intensely emotionally and politically charged one. As a result, Nextdoor faces a constant challenge in trying to keep the discussion civil. The company is working with the nonprofit American Leadership Forum on a series of videos teaching skills for civil discourse, and intends to make those videos available to Nextdoor users.

Libby Lee-Egan, a 33-year-old graphic designer from Berkeley, got involved in housing politics because of Nextdoor. She saw a post about a proposed 170-unit, mixed-income housing development on San Pablo Avenue and was excited about the project, but noticed many of her neighbors commenting on the post were not. So to raise support for the development, she and her husband started messaging like-minded neighbors on Nextdoor, created an email list to share updates on the project, and wrote letters to city officials. Lee-Egan channeled that momentum into co-founding the pro-housing organization East Bay for Everyone.

Then, she says, things turned ugly. Lee-Egan says members of her Nextdoor neighborhood began attacking her and her organization, calling East Bay for Everyone a ""developer front."" Someone called her a ""moron,"" and then accused her of being the ""free speech police"" when she reported it to Nextdoor.

Eventually, Lee-Egan deleted the Nextdoor app from her phone.

""It was kind of scary,"" she said, ""to know that people who live near me and know where I live are angry at me."" Her husband had their address on his Nextdoor profile.

Still, the San Pablo Avenue development is under construction now, and Lee-Egan feels a sense of pride every time she walks by.

In Foster City, a battle in recent months between pro-development and slow-growth residents - both with representatives serving as neighborhood leads - has led to insults, deleted posts and the banning of multiple members. Debate grew particularly hot around the proposed Pilgrim Triton project, which got the green light last fall for almost 100 new homes.

Each side accused the other of using its neighborhood leads to delete posts they didn't agree with. Evan Adams, a 39-year-old distributor of floor coverings, and a frequent pro-housing poster, logged on one day in October to find someone had posted a picture of him on Nextdoor, taken earlier that day without his knowledge, talking to Councilman Herb Perez at a Starbucks. The poster accused Adams of making pro-housing comments at the councilman's behest.

Many conversations, debates and fights that start on Nextdoor are having real-world impact. They're galvanizing people to show up at city hall, and even appear to be influencing local elections.

In Cupertino, Liang Chao, who has been a vocal critical of plans to redevelop Vallco Mall, won a City Council seat in November after frequently weighing in on Nextdoor housing debates.

""A lot of people actually got to know me through my postings,"" she said. But, she added, conversations on Nextdoor have become so divisive that she no longer finds the platform particularly useful.

Other politicians have found the vicious opposition they face on Nextdoor jarring. Foster City Mayor Hindi says he has friends in politics up and down the Peninsula who are wary of the site.

""You just mention Nextdoor,"" he said, ""and you see their face change.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКCalifornia home sales in November continued on a downward trend for the seventh consecutive month as prospective buyers continued to wait out the market

California home sales in November continued on a downward trend for the seventh consecutive month as prospective buyers continued to wait out the market. Sales in the San Francisco Bay Area have softened, as well. Home prices in the region, while still rising, are no longer climbing at the double-digit pace that occurred throughout much of 2018.

According to the California Association of Realtors, closed sales of existing, single-family homes in the state totaled 381,400 units in November, down 3.9 percent from the 397,060 level in October and down 13.4 percent from 440,340 home sales in November 2017. The statewide median home price declined to $554,760 in November, down 3 percent from $572,000 in October and up 1.5 percent from $546,820 in November 2017.

""The slowdown in price growth is occurring throughout the state, including regions that have strong economic fundamentals such as the San Francisco Bay Area,"" said C.A.R. senior vice president and chief economist Leslie Appleton-Young.еК""The deceleration in home price appreciation should be a welcome sign for potential buyers who have struggled in recent years against low inventory and rapidly rising home prices.""

Sales for the San Francisco Bay Area as a whole fell 11.5 percent from a year ago. All nine Bay Area counties recorded annual sales decreases, with Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo and Sonoma counties posting double-digit annual declines.

On a year-over-year basis, the Bay Area median price edged up 0.6 percent from November 2017. While home prices in Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties remain above $1 million, all but San Mateo County recorded a year-over-year price decline in November.

Santa Clara County homes sales fell 9.9 percent from November last year and were down 10.9 percent from October. The November median price for a single-family home in Santa Clara County was $1,250,000, a drop of 2.5 percent from the November 2017 median of $1,282,500 and down 3.1 percent from October's median of $1,290,000.

Statewide active listings rose for the eighth consecutive month after nearly three straight years of declines, increasing 31 percent from the previous year. November's listings increase was the largest since April 2014.

Santa Clara County's unsold inventory index, which is a ratio of inventory over sales, increased year-to-year from 1.2 months in November 2017 to 2.1 months in November 2018. The median number of days it took to sell a single-family home rose from nine days last year to 18 days in November 2018.

The 30-year, fixed-mortgage interest rate averaged 4.87 percent in November, up from 3.92 percent in November 2017, according to Freddie Mac. The five-year, adjustable mortgage interest rate also increased in November to an average of 4.11 percent from 3.24 from November 2017.

On Dec. 18, 2018, the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate for the fourth time in 2018. The Fed plans are to raise rates two more times this year. The rise in interest rates will mean it will cost more to borrow.

HIGHLIGHT:еКThere's evidence this skewed picture discourages women from aspiring to dozens of careers and increases discrimination and harassment of women who are already in certain jobs.

Men dominate Google image searches for most jobs  even for bartender, probation officer and medical scientist, roles in which women outnumber men.

In 57 percent of occupations, image searches indicate the jobs are more male-dominated than they actually are.

Theres evidence this skewed picture discourages women from aspiring to dozens of careers and increases discrimination and harassment of women who are already in those jobs.

Researchers from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center used a carefully calibrated and monitored artificial-intelligence algorithm to calculate gender representation in the top Google image search results for more than 100 occupations. To compare online representation to a jobs real-world gender breakdown, they compared results to Labor Department statistics.

In addition to overall representation, the researchers found images of men typically ranked higher in search results. The researchers generally encountered the first picture of a man as the second image on the page. The first woman frequently wouldnt show up until the fourth image.

Some of the jobs where women are underrepresented in images appeared to reflect stereotypes about masculinity, intimidation and force: Most bill collectors, probation officers and bartenders are women, yet Google search results paint an overwhelmingly male picture of each occupation.

Google also significantly underrepresents women as managers and chief executives. Only 28 percent of chief executives are women, but the share of women who appear as images in the top 100 Google results is even lower, just 10 percent. For general managers, those figures are 34 percent of the labor force and 15 percent of Google image searches.

Thats most troubling for what it says about how people perceive womens role in society, said Haley Swenson, a fellow at New America, a left-leaning think tank.

We know that what people see affects what they perceive to be normal, and that in turn affects behavior, Swenson said.

We cant bust open Googles black box and dissect their ranking system, but we can assume image search results broadly reflect supply and demand  supply because the search results represent the images media, corporations and users choose to represent professions, and demand because Google prioritizes images users link to and share.

When we learn more about how gender is being portrayed in that new information landscape, it might give us some understanding about how this could be shaping public perceptions of womens roles in the workplace, said Kim Parker, Pews social trends research director.

Meanwhile, search results overrepresent images of women in a minority of occupations.

Many are traditionally female occupations, such as singer, model and flight attendant, but image searches also return an unusually high share of women in male-dominated occupations, such as mechanic, computer programmer and police officer. It may be driven by the laudable impulse to signal women are equally able to perform such jobs, Swenson said, but that, too, can create problems.

In an effort to showcase diversity, people might be underestimating how sharp the divides are in the workplace, she said, adding that Google might lead people to underestimate the extent of occupational segregation in the United States.

Google image searches and media coverage might be the only preview of a job for many underrepresented candidates, since theyre less likely to know women employed in these fields.

Research supports the idea that skewed representation can shape whether the next generation can see themselves doing a particular job.

How young people choose their career  a lot of that is shaped by perceived norms, Swenson said. If you dont think its normal for a person like you to do a certain job, then you just dont do that.

Lopsided representation also affects the people doing those jobs. If people see their jobs portrayed as overwhelmingly male, it reinforces the idea women dont belong there and emboldens discrimination and harassment.

In heavily male-dominated workplaces, one of the things that drives sexual harassment is men in those jobs perceive women as infringing in a space thats supposed to be theirs, Swenson said.

An earlier Pew survey found 32 percent of women who work in mostly female workplaces complain of sexual harassment. In mostly male workplaces, about 49 percent say theres a problem.

Pew researchers Onyi Lam, Brian Broderick, Stefan Wojcik and Adam Hughes began by compiling a list of more than 200 occupations. They narrowed it down to occupations with more than 100,000 workers nationwide for which the Labor Department released gender breakdowns.

They eliminated professions that didnt have enough image-search results on Google or enough images of people performing the job. When multiple people were shown performing a job, they analyzed each person separately. When an occupation contained several job names in the description, such as models and demonstrators, they treated each as a separate occupation. They also simplified some Labor Department jargon. Postsecondary teacher became professor, for example.

The 10,000-plus images analyzed were collected between July 7 and Sept. 13, 2018.

Pew trained and tested its algorithm on a separate data set of about 25,000 images classified by gender and other characteristics. Algorithms have been criticized for having been trained primarily on images of people of European ancestry, so Pew said researchers created their own more diverse training image data set. When their algorithm was fed images it hadnt seen before, it classified them with 95 percent accuracy. It also showed no gender bias.",212,David Streitfeld; New York Times,3-Jan-19,Did 2018's Troubles Clip Wings Of Big Tech?

SAN JOSE, Calif. - Silicon Valley ended 2018 somewhere it had never been: embattled.

Lawmakers across the political spectrum say Big Tech, for so long the exalted embodiment of American genius, has too much power. Once seen as a force for making our lives better and our brains smarter, tech is now accused of inflaming, radicalizing, dumbing down and squeezing the masses. Tech company stocks have been pummeled from their highs. Regulation looms. Even tech executives are calling for it.

In the face of such a sustained assault, this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low. It could devote some of its mountains of cash - Apple alone has $237 billion in the bank - to genuine good works, and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny.

That is not the path the companies are taking.

""The tech companies are not flinching,"" said Bob Staedler, a Silicon Valley consultant. ""Nothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back. Instead, they are expanding. They're going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz-bang thing.""

There is so much of life that remains undisrupted. The companies are competing to own the cloud - to become, in essence, the internet's landlord.

When every home has an Amazon Echo, Google Home, an Apple HomePod or some other smart speaker, the companies are already signaling, all human and metaphysical needs will be fulfilled.

For those who insist on venturing out, there will be driverless cars operated by Big Tech. And the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence, with consequences unclear even to them.

To accomplish all this, Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees, which means it needs somewhere to put them.

This isn't a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters. It means building new campuses around the country.

Big Tech's push into New York City and the Washington area has been well-documented in recent months, with Google bulking up in the first and Amazon planning satellite offices in both.

But even in its backyard of Silicon Valley, which is a mess of traffic congestion and housing prices that have attained levels even well-paid engineers can scarcely afford, there is a boom that, if anything, is accelerating.

Anyone who wants to believe Big Tech is chastened should visit a section of San Jose just west of downtown, a jumble of car washes and auto-body shops with a sprinkling of modern apartments. On a short street there is a house nearly a century old, a tiny thing with only one bath. Google bought it and another house last month in a package deal for $4 million, according to county documents reviewed by the San Jose Mercury News.

Multiply that real estate transaction by dozens, big parcels and small, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to date. Google is planning very long term here. The buses, light rail, Caltrain and Amtrak trains that converge on the Diridon Station transit center will give the company an opportunity to embed mass transit into its growth. The eventual result will be a new Google campus of 8 million square feet with offices for 20,000 workers, a figure that is more than the company's total employment in 2009.

But Diridon Station is just a part of Google's Silicon Valley expansion. A week before the company got the two houses, it bought a 100,000-square-foot building in Palo Alto, Calif., for $70 million.

Facebook keeps growing, too. In the spring, it leased 1 million square feet in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale for its fast-growing community operations team. And it will soon move this year into 750,000 square feet in a San Francisco tower, making it the third-biggest tech tenant in the city, after Salesforce and Uber.

In total, Google's employment increased 21 percent in the last year. Facebook's workforce rose by 45 percent in that time, to 34,000, and it is advertising 2,700 additional jobs.

Amazon's head count tripled over the last three years, thanks to its warehouses and the acquisition of Whole Foods. It is only the second company in the United States to employ more than 500,000 people - and that is not counting its contractors.

The expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech: It is barely getting started.

""For all intents and purposes, we're only 35 years into a 75- or 80-year process of moving from analog to digital,"" said Tim Bajarin, a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple, IBM and Microsoft. ""The image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit, but the reality is that we, the consumers, are constantly voting for them.""

""Much as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide,"" said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Big Tech needs to be regulated, many are beginning to argue, and yet there are worries about giving that power to the government.

""The government doesn't have a good clue,"" Bajarin said. ""They're not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulation.""

Which leaves regulation up to the companies themselves, always a dubious proposition.",213,Levi Sumagaysay,3-Jan-19,"World Bank: Robots Are Taking Some Jobs, But Not All",499,The East Bay Times (california),,"World Bank: Robots Are Taking Some Jobs, But Not All

HIGHLIGHT:еКAutomation is displacing some lower-skilled workers and moving some jobs elsewhere, and exacerbating the gap between rich and poor.

Some Amazon stores have no cashiers, and Waymo is testing self-driving taxis. Are robots taking our jobs?

It depends on what you do and where you do it, according to a new report by the World Bank released this week.

Advanced economies have shed industrial jobs, but the rise of the industrial sector in East Asia has more than compensated for this loss, said the report, titled The Changing Nature of Work.

That may seem like good news in a broad sense, but not to the people whose jobs are disappearing. Technological advances and automation are making the rich richer and the poor poorer.

Workers in some sectors benefit handsomely from technological progress, whereas those in others are displaced and have to retool to survive, the report said. Platform technologies create huge wealth but place it in the hands of only a few people.

The World Bank recommends a new social contract that includes investment in education and retraining. Would that help American workers?

Policy-makers in Washington may have talked about the need to better prepare lower-skilled workers for the future transition, but little has been done, Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington-based think tank, said Thursday.

It is likely that the Democratically-controlled House will offer up budgets that increase funding for worker training and dislocated-worker programs, Atkinson added, but said the Republican-controlled Senate may not spring for as much as Democrats want.

Another issue: Not all new work created by technological advances is advanced work. The emergence of gig-economy work  informal work with no protections, which is common in the developing world  is affecting people in developed countries such as the United States.

But Atkinson said gig-economy jobs are not growing much. He cited studies including one by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which found that jobs through online platforms such as Uber, Lyft and TaskRabbit accounted for only 0.5 percent of all U.S. jobs in 2015.

The World Bank report also pointed out that technological changes affecting the nature of work call attention to the relevance of labor laws.

Labor codes should clearly define what it means to be an employee in current labor markets, the report said.

HIGHLIGHT:еКIf you're trying to recall what your members of Congress accomplished in 2018, the answer is: They grew older.

By Avi Selk | The Washington Post

WASHINGTON - If youre trying to recall what your members of Congress accomplished in 2018, the answer is: They grew older.

The 115th Congress was already one of the oldest in history when it convened at the dawn of the Trump administration - average age 58 in the House, 62 in the Senate, 90 billion or so in the relativistic time scale of the online generation, in front of which Congress spent much of the year embarrassing itself. By the time the 115th hobbled into extinction at the end of 2018, artifacts from its attempts to engage the younger folk and their digital ways lay strewn across the internet like the fossil record of an obsolete species.

There were the agonizing video clips from Aprils Facebook hearing, in which 68-year-old Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., attempted to ask Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg a question about data privacy, and revealed a conception of social media resembling a wad of tangled Christmas lights: Do you track devices that an individual who uses Facebook has that is connected to the device that they use for their Facebook connection, but not necessarily connected to Facebook?

Im not - Im not sure of the answer to that question, Zuckerberg replied, as if he could even be sure it was a question.

Come December it was the Google chief Sundar Pichais turn to visit the Capitol and watch Rep. Steve Cohen, the 69-year-old Democrat from Tennessee, wave his hands in the air and complain: I use your apparatus often, or your search engine, and I dont understand all of the different ways that you can turn off the locations. Theres so many different things!

These hearings were live-streamed to the general populace, more than half of whom are under 40, many of whom were horrified to discover that a country being revolutionized by technology is apparently overseen by people whose worldview calcified in the previous century.

Less surprised, but no less dismayed, were some of the tech advocates who have spent years trying to discuss issues like net neutrality and data privacy on Capitol Hill with representatives and staffers they say are somewhat less than engaged.

Theres different eras where people come from. Its hard to transcend that, said Daniel Schuman, a former Hill staffer who works for a tech-oriented lobbying group, Demand Progress. Its like Mad Men. Youve got the secretary who does the typing and the librarian who does the research. Lindsey Graham was bragging about having a flip phone!

Zach Graves, who regularly commutes between Silicon Valley and D.C. for his work at a free-market tech advocacy group called the Lincoln Network, has been wincing through congressional tech hearings since long before the Google and Facebook spectacles became viral dark comedy.

Theres lot of run-of-the-mill hearings where thats about par for the course, he said. Its clear from the kinds of questions they were asking they werent prepped properly.

In particular he remembers the House Agriculture Committees attempt to take on cryptocurrency. Premised on the possibility that Bitcoins might fall into the same regulatory category as soybeans and corn, Julys hearing opened with a panel of technologists trying to explain blockchain technology.

A CEO with purple-dyed hair made a particularly diligent effort to connect with the Congress members. Email allows you to send a digital version of a birthday card to a grandchild instantly, she wrote in her prepared statement. Cryptocurrency like bitcoin gives you the ability to put the digital equivalent of $10 inside that card.

But the generational chasm became apparent when the 74-year-old ranking Democrat, Rep. Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, took the mic, rubbed something out of his eyes and announced, Um. I dont know where to start. He explained that he was still uncomfortable with President Franklin Roosevelts decision to abolish the gold standard in 1933, and liked this new idea no better. Theyre just creating this money out of nowhere! he said.

The problem youre having is you DONT UNDERSTAND TECHNOLOGY YOU 8-track listening fools, countered one of several hundred cryptocurrency enthusiasts watching the proceedings live on YouTube.

There is a counterargument to this criticism, which issues from the offices of the lawmakers themselves. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R.-Utah, who leaves office Thursday at age 84, was pilloried during Aprils Facebook hearings for asking Zuckerberg: How do you sustain a business model in which users dont pay for your service?

Senator, we run ads, Zuckerberg replied, smiling cherubically, and video of this exchange instantly became a viral emblem for a doddering Congress.

Orrin Hatch just asked how Facebook makes money, but, in his defense, he was distracted because he forgot where he parked his dinosaur.#Zuckerberg

Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) April 10, 2018

This irritated Hatchs communication director, Matt Whitlock, who pointed out that the senator had spoken at length about Facebooks advertiser-based business model minutes earlier, and asked his infamous question semi-rhetorically, to have Zuckerberg confirm it.

Senator Hatch has some of the most tech-literate staff on Capitol Hill and has authored more tech legislation than anyone, Whitlock wrote to The Washington Post. But he became a meme of tech illiteracy because so many reporters only saw a 12-second video in their Twitter feeds, not the three minutes preceding it.

Perhaps one part of the problem is Congress-illiteracy among tech reporters.

Maybe so. And if an elderly Congress is a problem, its one the United States has managed throughout its history.

Most Americans (at least the white male ones) had not yet seen their 15th birthday before the first census in 1790, but were governed by a 1st Congress in which the average senator was a methuselean 47 years old, according to the U.S. Senate Historical Office.

The average age in the Senate has ticked up steadily along with that of the population, as it has in the House since at least the 1940s, when Congressional Quarterly began keeping track of ages in the lower chamber. Its hard to be certain given incomplete and sometimes inconsistent age records, but the just-concluded 115th Congress appears to have been the oldest in history - with an average age of 58 1/2 as of the day it convened, if you combine Senate Historical Office and CQ figures.

We dont yet have comprehensive age data for the next Congress, but it convenes this week after an election that added a historic number of minorities, women and young people to government. The midterm election quintupled the number of millennials who will hold a House seat, according to the Pew Research Center, though they still make up a paltry share, with just over two dozen seats. Among this new class of digital natives is New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29, who will become the youngest woman to join Congress (and who complained about being mistaken for an intern when she toured the Capitol after her election).

The age difference is a huge disparity. My friends and I had talked about forever, said Katie Hill, 31, who unseated a Republican incumbent in Californias 25th district last month by campaigning partly on generational issues - not so much technology as college debt, health care reform and climate change.

The technology helps, though. Hill said she and a handful of other under-40s elected in November have befriended each other as they prepare to move into their new offices. They chat mostly through text.

When Hill introduces herself to incumbents, she said, she usually does so in person.

Sometimes they ask, How old are you? If you dont mind me asking?  she said. I say 31, and they start laughing. It blows their mind, how young.",215,David Streitfeld,3-Jan-19,"Big Tech May Look Troubled, But It's Just Getting Started",1389,The New York Times - International Edition,Technology,"Big Tech May Look Troubled, But It's Just Getting Started

ABSTRACT

Even as Facebook, Google and others confronted challenges in 2018, their ambitions were undimmed. After all, so much of life remains undisrupted.

FULL TEXT

SAN JOSE, Calif. - Silicon Valley ended 2018 somewhere it had never been: embattled.

Lawmakers across the political spectrum say Big Tech, for so long the exalted embodiment of American genius, has too much power. Once seen as a force for making our lives better and our brains smarter, tech is now accused of inflaming, radicalizing, dumbing down and squeezing the masses. Tech company stocks have been pummeled from their highs. Regulation looms. Even tech executives are calling for it.

In the face of such a sustained assault, this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low. It could devote some of its mountains of cash - Apple alone has $237 billion in the bank - to genuine good works, and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny.

That is not the path the companies are taking.

""The tech companies are not flinching,"" said Bob Staedler, a Silicon Valley consultant. ""Nothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back. Instead, they are expanding. They're going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz-bang thing.""

There is so much of life that remains undisrupted. The companies are competing to own the cloud - to become, in essence, the internet's landlord. They have designs on cities: Google made a deal in 2017 to reimagine a chunk of waterfront Toronto from the ground up. Amazon is reworking the definition of community from the inside, as warehouses in rural areas provide the urban middle class with everything they want to stay home all weekend.

These changes are only beginning to redefine society. When every home has an Amazon Echo, Google Home, an Apple HomePod or some other smart speaker, the companies are already signaling, all human and metaphysical needs will be fulfilled. For those who insist on venturing out, there will be driverless cars operated by Big Tech. And the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence, with consequences unclear even to them.

To accomplish all this, Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees, which means it needs somewhere to put them. This isn't a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters. It means building new campuses around the country.

Big Tech's push into New York City and the Washington area has been well documented in recent months, with Google bulking up in the first and Amazon planning satellite offices in both. But even in its backyard of Silicon Valley, which is a mess of traffic congestion and housing prices that have attained levels even well-paid engineers can scarcely afford, there is a boom that, if anything, is accelerating.

Anyone who wants to believe Big Tech is chastened should visit a section of San Jose just west of downtown, a jumble of carwashes and auto-body shops with a sprinkling of modern apartments. On a short street there is a house nearly a century old, a tiny thing with only one bath. Google bought it and another house last month in a package deal for $4 million, according to county documents reviewed by The Mercury News.

Multiply that real estate transaction by dozens, big parcels and small, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to date. Google is planning very long term here. The buses, light rail, Caltrain and Amtrak trains that converge on the Diridon Station transit center will give the company an opportunity to embed mass transit into its growth. The eventual result will be a new Google campus of eight million square feet with offices for 20,000 workers, a figure that is more than the company's total employment in 2009.

But Diridon Station is just a part of Google's Silicon Valley expansion. A week before the company got the two houses, it bought a 100,000-square-foot building in Palo Alto, Calif., for $70 million.

Facebook keeps growing, too. In the spring, it leased one million square feet in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale for its fast-growing community operations team, which deals with safety and security issues confronting Facebook users. And it will soon move this year into 750,000 square feet in a San Francisco tower, making it the third-biggest tech tenant in the city, after Salesforce and Uber.

In total, Google's employment increased 21 percent in the last year. Facebook's work force rose by 45 percent in that time, to 34,000, and it is advertising 2,700 additional jobs.

Amazon's head count tripled over the last three years, thanks to its warehouses and the acquisition of Whole Foods. It is only the second company in the United States to employ more than 500,000 people - and that is not counting its contractors.

The expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech: It is barely getting started.

""For all intents and purposes, we're only 35 years into a 75- or 80-year process of moving from analog to digital,"" said Tim Bajarin, a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple, IBM and Microsoft. ""The image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit, but the reality is that we the consumers are constantly voting for them.""

That's evident in how robust Big Tech's businesses remain. Last March, the research firm eMarketer said Facebook, including its less controversial photo-sharing site, Instagram, would earn $21 billion this year from digital ads in the United States. In September, it raised that forecast to $22.87 billion.

EMarketer also revised up its forecasts of Google's digital ad revenues in the United States for 2018, 2019 and 2020. The third big digital advertising recipient is Amazon, which is far behind the leaders but gaining ground fast.

The contradiction is becoming increasingly obvious. One important way Big Tech serves its customers is by tracking their movements and purchases, which is beginning to unnerve at least some of us. In a Pew Research Center survey in June, 42 percent of adult Facebook users said they had taken a break of several weeks from the site. But even as we say we trust tech less, we invite it deeper into our lives.

Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, Google's parent company, together generated $166.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2018 alone - up 24 percent from a year earlier, when the four companies hauled in $134.4 billion.

""Much as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide,"" said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Big Tech needs to be regulated, many are beginning to argue, and yet there are worries about giving that power to the government.

""The government doesn't have a good clue,"" said Mr. Bajarin, the consultant. ""They're not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulation.""

Which leaves regulation up to the companies themselves, always a dubious proposition.

""For Facebook to have a better year in 2019, it needs to be more upfront and transparent,"" said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer. This was also the advice Facebook got for 2018, to little avail.

All this could change if the anti-tech mood continues to swell or the economy hits a really rough patch. On the other hand, the last recession tended to work in Big Tech's favor by giving smaller competitors even more to worry about.

During the 2008 financial crisis, Amazon's North American media sales increased 20 percent. Borders, one of its biggest book-selling competitors, saw revenue drop 9 percent, reported a record loss and was soon defunct.

With so little to really worry about, Big Tech is planning for a future far beyond any present-day turmoil. Google, which has 3,500 job openings, says it is too early to say what the thousands of Diridon employees will do. But Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California, has a good idea: everything.

""They're in the transportation business, the medical business, every business,"" said Mr. Taplin, a frequent critic of how Big Tech took over a decentralized, independent internet. ""There is no aspect of your life that they will not be involved in.""

Gary Dillabough may have plans to develop or revamp some of the most anticipated projects and buildings in downtown San Jose, but he doesn't like to think of himself as a developer.

""Hopefully we're people who can create an urban community or great user experiences,"" said the 55-year-old real estate and venture capital investor. Dillabough, along with real estate guru Jeff Arrillaga, founded and leads a company called Urban Community, which captures the legacy he's hoping to create as an ""urban community builder.

""If we do our jobs well, that's what people, hopefully, will say,"" he said.

And while San Jose's downtown revival story has been dominated by talk of Google and its mega campus plans, the momentum started well before the tech titan announced in 2017 that San Jose was the next ""it"" place.

Dillabough is part of a tenacious group of investors and developers - or urban community builders - who have been laying the foundation in recent years for San Jose's downtown growth after several false starts.

Crane Watch map: See the more than 100 major residential, office, retail and mixed-use projects in San Jose's development pipeline

Downtown enthusiasts say this time, the momentum is real and lasting, and while longtime developers in the area have been critical to the city's success, downtown has been buoyed by a new generation of investors who have visions for the commercial core that reach far beyond their own property lines.

Downtown San Jose has more than 30 development projects in its pipeline totaling more than 23 million square feet of potential new office space, 7,600 new residential units and more than 650 new hotel rooms, according to Business Journal research. Those numbers include projects that have been proposed, entitled or are under construction.

Scott Knies, executive director of the San Jose Downtown Association, says the current momentum started a few years ago, when new investors began picking up and reimagining Class B buildings that had sat underutilized for decades.

""Speaking to this new generation of owners, they were coming in with entirely different expectations,"" Knies said. ""They were trying to look at, 'Well, this district is kind of dead during the day, so we need more offices here.'""

When Dillabough talks about his downtown projects, for instance, he can spit out stats on square footages and parking ratios, but he's just as quick to draw or pantomime a map filled with paseos and maybe a fountain or two. He muses about retail that may or may not end up in his buildings and is working on new ways to get community members invested - both personally and financially - in his projects. He wants to start a voluntary program for property owners to help out with homelessness in the city.

Urban Community is behind downtown projects like the historic Bank of Italy revamp, a project that will span most of the surrounding block near North First and East Santa Clara streets. That corner has the potential to be downtown's ""main and main,"" said San Jose Downtown Manager Blage Zelalich.

AlsoеКon that cornerеКis a onetime JC Penney's store that sat underutilized for years, with the ground level walled off from pedestrians. That was until Lift Partners picked it up as part of a larger portfolio in 2016. The development group set out to make the 101,000-square-foot building a choice location for creative office tenants and landed a lease for the ground level that will bring the first Blue Bottle Coffee shop to the South Bay.

""There's a lot of momentum behind it now, but when we were doing it, it took a lot of convincing of retailers, investors and lenders to believe in the story,"" said Chris Freise, managing partner and co-founder at Lift Partners. ""Selling it kind of snowballs, so you get the Blue Bottle, and Blue Bottle led to other retailers believing that this was an up-and-coming area.""

Freise is also part of a new generation of owners that had begun investing back in 2016, before Google was a glimmer in most downtown San Jose onlookers' eyes. That's when they they picked up a three-building portfolio from Saratoga Capital for $33.5 million. Since then, the group revamped and helped find tenants for the buildings, then sold the portfolio piecemeal for a combined $72.5 million.

""What tenants want was all here, they just didn't know it,"" Freise said. ""You couldn't convince an office tenant to come tour San Jose that was coming from Mountain View or Sunnyvale, but that is not the case anymore.""

Other steadfast downtown San Jose investors and developers have helped the area get to where it is today. Depending how far back one wants to look, the list includes, but is not limited to, The Sobrato Organization, JP DiNapoli, Lew Wolff, Richard Berg, the late Jim Fox and John McEnery, who built the popular San Pedro Square food hall.

Longtime San Jose developer Swenson has a master plan for the city's Guadalupe River, where the company doesn't own the land it's proposing for redevelopment. The effort, unveiled in late 2017, was led by Swenson President Case Swenson.

""There are still some of those kind of original, old-time investors,"" Zelalich said. ""But there certainly has been, over the last two to three years, this infusion of new blood interested in investing in downtown in a small-scale way, but that makes a very large impact.""

See all the major projects in San Jose's development pipeline on our Crane Watch map.

Meanwhile, bigger players have started to enter the scene since Google said in 2017 that it plans to build a tech campus on downtown's far west side.

The one that made the biggest headlines this year was prolific San Francisco-based developer Jay Paul Co., which purchased the 600,000-square-foot CityView Plaza in July for $283.5 million, and then picked up the former JC Penney building for $46 million.

Those purchases marked Jay Paul's first entrance into San Jose. Not long after the deal closed, the company said it plans to redevelop the nearly block-long mixed-use CityView Plaza, likely into something much larger.

And while investors and city officials agree both Google and Jay Paul's entrance to downtown is critical to the area's future growth and momentum, their presence also means the secret is out about San Jose's new cool status. That comes with some drawbacks.

Most notably, land prices have surged since Google's interest in the city was revealed in the summer of 2017. New investors have entered the market, paying top-dollar for existing buildings with room for improvement and some developers, like Jay Paul, are moving ahead quickly and confidently.

But that means some of the people who laid that foundation - who invest on a smaller, but impactful scale - are feeling the squeeze. Freise acknowledges that it's gotten harder, but maintains ""there's still opportunity.""

Dillabough, for his part, says he's planning to hold back on scouting new deals because of how high land prices have climbed in the last few years. ""The pricing just doesn't make much much sense to me anymore,"" he said. ""But it's great that Google came down. Google wasn't a factor at all in why we came down here, so that was a nice validation.""

Gary Dillabough always wanted to work in real estate and development, but first took a detour through Silicon Valley's tech, startup and venture capital worlds before becoming one of the most prolific downtown San Jose real estate investors in recent history.

To be clear, he hasn't left his past professions behind, even as he and his investment partners scooped up properties worth hundreds of millions of dollars over the past year and a half and are now embarking on multiple building rehabs and redevelopments. Instead, he's trying to integrate the development, VC and tech worlds, mixing green building and small-scale investing technologies he invests in into his building projects. In true tech culture fashion, he eschews the title of developer for less formal monikers, like ""urban community builder.""

""Fortunately, a lot of the jobs I've had, whether it was in real estate or in technology, ... there are all kinds of different components that I think are allowing me to see the equation just a little differently than a traditional developer,"" he said in a recent interview.

Dillabough has amassed large pieces of San Jose over the past year or so, but is still a bit of a mystery in the local development world. Along with partnering with various developers, he also leads a company called Urban Community along with co-founder Jeff Arrillaga.

Among the properties he's working on: the old Camera 12 theater along Second Street, where he and investment partner Don Imwalle are aiming to bring in a new entertainment use. He also owns the nine-story building at 152 N. Third St., where WeWork is gearing up to open its newest San Jose location.

Meanwhile, his company is also working on new plans for the three-acre Valley Title property in the city's SoFA district, which is ripe for redevelopment. The group is working on re-entitling the planned Museum Place development and expansion of the current Tech Museum at Park Avenue and South Market Street.

But the property that has received the most fanfare is the historic Bank of Italy building, which he purchased in late 2017 a limited liability company with an address that leads back to WeWork's New York office. He's since picked up most of the low-slung, parking-filled block around the nearly 100-year-old building at the corner of North First and East Santa Clara streets.

Dillabough has worked on multiple rehabs of existing Silicon Valley buildings in the past, transforming older, existing properties into award-winning, high-functioning, net-zero energy structures. But developing from the ground up will be a new endeavor for the 55-year-old investor.

When he thinks about what has prepared him for the challenge, Dillabough mostly talks about people - specifically, other developers and investors he's partnered with on Silicon Valley projects, like Imwalle, who is well-versed in retail and entertainment developments; Kevin Bates, who has been instrumental in past net-zero energy projects Dillabough has worked on; and Adam Neumann, co-founder and CEO of WeWork.

""The guy who inspires me in San Francisco is Marc Benioff because Marc really cares, whether it's medical care or its homelessness or corporations' responsibility to participate in the community,"" he said. ""What I like about what he is doing is he's just trying to, before it gets legislated again, he said, 'Hey, I'm going to try to do the right thing and maybe I can inspire other companies to do it.'""

Below is part of a larger interview with Dillabough about his vision for San Jose's downtown core, his properties and investment partners. The story has been edited for length and clarity.

How is your lens different and what do you bring to the table to actually make that vision happen?

I think what we did when we first started this whole process, we put together a plan that kind of helped us figure out if we were going to create what we thought would be a really good community, what would that consist of?

In our plan, it's to have eight specific neighborhoods. One or two neighborhoods would be around young families and some would be specific to housing. Some, like SoFA, would be around arts and culture and some would be around historic buildings. Then the goal was to try to buy one or two properties in each one of those neighborhoods and do something catalytic that would get people there thinking that, 'Hey, that's pretty cool idea!'

Can you offer a timeline of when we'll see new proposals on your owned properties?

It's Museum Place first and foremost and we've got to get that reprogrammed to all office. We just hired a team to help us entitle and were starting to look at architectural designs for Valley Title, so that'd be number two. Our whole thing is that we're not here to land bank; we want to bring it to market, so then we're going to look at things like our Fountain Alley pretty quickly, but you have to kind of sequence some of these things or you would have too many things going on.

What can you tell me about your investors or other groups you're working with?

Some of the money that we work with is technology-driven capital. ... That's really where it started: I had a handful of my friends who have done relatively well and said, 'Hey, let's try this real estate thing. It's a way to diversify out of the equity market.' And the WeWork guys have certainly been a partner of ours on a number of projects. Adam Neumann (WeWork CEO) has inspired me. I think the way that he looks at how real estate should serve companies - that it shouldn't be an anchor to a company, it should be really be a partner - whenever I spend time with him, he just reinforces that, and it's given me kind of a roadmap of where we want to go.

Do you think that Google's presence in downtown San Jose is going to make things better or more difficult?

They're going to do a great job helping Diridon Station become a real transit hub. This is purely speculative, but I think their presence will help make the Guadalupe River really cool over time. We could never spend any money on that - meaningful money - to help that get better, but I think Google can. Having another 30,000 or 40,000 people in downtown would help all of the local businesses, as long as those guys aren't having all their lunches and things inside the Google campus.

On that note, what is your dream for what downtown San Jose will be in the coming years?

I would say in seven years we'd have 10 million square feet of new office space. We'd have 10 million square feet of new residential space and we'd have a really rich retail urban fabric in the downtown core. I think we would have thought about ideas, like making our cities more resilient by having a micro grid built into what's created. I think we'd be able to incorporate all the cool technologies around transportation systems and I think that San Jose can become a real model for other cities around the world to learn from.

HIGHLIGHT:еКOnly five states had more wildly gyrating rankings than California -- Hawaii, Vermont, Alaska, Nevada and Connecticut.

Expand

You can't improve much if you don't know your own strengths and weaknesses.

So with a new year upon us, let's review how California performed in 2018 - as measured by a selection of rankings that serve our national thirst to debate who's No. 1 and who's dead last.

I filled my trusty spreadsheet with 14 state-by-state rankings on various quality-of-life subjects. I used different sources for each ranking to keep biases to a minimum.

When I averaged these rankings for each state, I found California with a middle-of-the-pack score - No. 27 out of the 50 states, smack between Kansas and Missouri. Not bad. Not great.

Tops by my math were New Hampshire, Utah and Washington. Worst? Louisiana, Mississippi, and West Virginia. (Since many of you will want to know: California's economic arch-rival Texas was No. 19.)

Rankings for California really varied, which suggests the state - and I don't just mean government - is really good at some stuff and fairly poor at other stuff.

Only five states had more wildly gyrating rankings than California - Hawaii, Vermont, Alaska, Nevada and Connecticut - when I applied standard deviation math to the 14 ranking results. It's what I'd call a quasi-coastal crowd.

This geeky volatility measurement found that rankings were most consistent for Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Montana. This is a decidedly a middle-America grouping.

The variance in how California scored is certainly food for thought about how the state can better itself. So, here's how 14 rankings graded California, from what you could say are the state's best attributes to its worst.

1. Worker rights: Oxfam gave California its best grade, a No. 2 ranking behind Washington and just ahead of Massachusetts. It's not surprising for a pro-labor state еКthat make some bosses say it's nearly impossible to fire somebody. Worst place to work, Oxfam says? Virginia, Mississippi and Alabama.

2. Economic strength: 24/7 Wall Street gave California a lofty No. 8 ranking, crediting its innovative workplace culture for creating lots of jobs and huge wealth. The best economies, to 24/7 Wall Street's eyes, were in Colorado, Utah, and Massachusetts. Worst? West Virginia, Alaska and Louisiana.

3. Raising families: WalletHub gave California a No. 10 ranking for plenty to do and see, which outweighed high costs. Top states for child-rearing were Massachusetts, Minnesota and New Hampshire. Worst? New Mexico, Mississippi and Alabama.

4. Being a patient: United Health Foundation's yardstick scored California's healthcare 12th best for its relatively broad availability and higher quality of care. Top spots to be sick were Hawaii, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Worst? Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.

5. Livability: Gallup's year-round polling on social and economic issues gave California a No. 14 ranking. Top places for quality of life by this scorecard were South Dakota, Vermont and Hawaii. Worst? West Virginia, Louisiana and Arkansas.

6. Job growth: As of November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment figures showed California with the 20th best job creation on a percentage basis. Best for new employment was Nevada, Arizona and Wyoming. Worst job markets? Vermont, Alaska and West Virginia.

7. Personal freedom: The Cato Institute, often a harsh critic of the state, gave California a No. 23 ranking for laws friendly to the populace. Tops for these freedoms, according to these rankings were Maine, Nevada and New Mexico. Worst? Texas, Alabama and Hawaii.

8. New neighbors: Census data as of July showed California with the 24th fastest population growth on a percentage basis. Tops for new folks was Nevada, Idaho and Utah. Least attractive? West Virginia, Illinois and Alaska.

9. Business climate:еКIf California is great for workers, it makes sense that CNBC would give the state a middling No. 25 ranking as a place from which CEOs want to operate. Most ""business-friendly"" according to these rankings was Texas then Washington and Utah. Worst? Alaska, Mississippi and West Virginia.

10. Education: US News & World Report gave California a mid-range No. 26 ranking for its challenged K-12 systems and its top-flight higher education. Best for students was Massachusetts then New Jersey and Utah. Worst? New Mexico, Louisiana and South Carolina.

11. Government solvency: George Mason U. economists, known for their conservative leanings, graded the financial health of California's government at No. 42. that's reflection of the state's volatile income streams and sizable long-term obligations. In best monetary shape, by Gorge Mason's standards, were Nebraska, South Dakota, and Tennessee. Biggest risks were in Illinois, Connecticut, and New Jersey.

12 (tie). Taxes: No Californian would be surprised to hear the anti-tax Tax Foundation scored the state California lowly 49th for its lofty government levies and fees - topped only by New Jersey and just ahead of New York. Best places for taxpayers, according to the foundation, were Wyoming, Alaska and South Dakota.

12 (tie). Cost of living:еКAnybody surprised, Part II? Missouri's tracking of how expensive life is in each state shows California as the second priciest place to live. Hawaii was most expensive, by this math; New York was No. 3. Looking for a bargain? Try the low-cost leaders Mississippi, Oklahoma or Arkansas.

14. Transportation: Recent gas-tax debates did have a universal truth: California roads stink. Bankrate scored the state dead-last at No. 50 for everything transportation-related, just ahead of Hawaii and Connecticut. Best places to get around, by this yardstick, were in North Dakota, Iowa and Ohio.

HIGHLIGHT:еКSingle-family home sales in Santa Cruz County dropped in November - from 183 a year ago to 134 - and the median price, the midpoint of what sold, was $911,250.

SANTA CRUZ - Single-family home sales in Santa Cruz County dropped in November - from 183 a year ago to 134 - and the median price, the midpoint of what sold, was $911,250, according to Gary Gangnes of Real Options Realty, who tracks the numbers.

Sellers who expected they could tack 5 percent onto their asking price found fewer buyers. Deals were made after sellers lowered the price, sometimes more than once.

""I think it's buyer fatigue,"" said Paul Bailey, co-owner of Bailey Properties with 43 years in real estate, citing negative political news, stock market gyrations, the Federal Reserve raising interest rates as reasons for buyers slowing down.

""We're seeing homes sell if they're priced correctly,"" he said. ""It's not about the color of the carpet, it's the location and the price.""

Buyers have more to choose fromеК - a big change after years of shrinking listings.

As of the first week of December, there were 425еКsingle-family homes for sale, up from 387 a year, and 131 condos and town homes for sale, up from 75 a year ago, according to Gangnes.

A key indicator shows the market is less of a seller's market. The unsold inventory index, how long it would take to sell available homes at the current sales rate, jumped to 3.2 months from 2.1 months a year ago for single-family homes and to 3.9 months from 2.1 months a year ago for condos.

More homes

Bailey calculates there are 1.9 homes per buyer, up from .8 per buyer in March, when the median price set a new record of $935,100.

He said that means there's a balance, with neither buyers nor sellers having more leverage.

""We're not used to this,"" he said, recalling the last time the real estate market was this way was in the late 1990s.

Forrest Cambell of Monterey Bay Mortgage in Soquel said he's seen sellers more willing to make repairs or give credits to buyers ""whereas previously the buyers had less opportunity to negotiate.""

The housing market has shifted from one side to the other, with sellers having the edge as prices advanced during the housing bubble, buyers having the edge as prices plummeted in the housing collapse, then sellers regaining the edge again due to limited inventory.

Bailey said the up-and-down of the stock market may help buyers if worried investors shift their funds out of stocks and into investments such as bonds, Treasury bills and mortgage-backed securities.

""That liquifies our type of interest rates,"" he said, adding that rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage rates, currently about 5 percent, could drop to 4.5 percent, an incentive for buyers.

Tax changes

Seb Frey of Realty World Virtuoso in Capitola contends 2018 was the peak year for local real estate, with the market stalling because buyers can't afford to pay more for a home.

He expects a drag on the 2019 market when taxpayers see the full impact of the reductions in state and local taxes and mortgage interest tax deductions.

""For most would be buyers in the greater Bay Area, owning a home won't pencil out favorably on a month-to-month basis,"" he said.

Amba DesJardins, an agent with Coldwell Banker in Santa Cruz, noted that ""record levels of sustained low employment have often been an indicator of a forthcoming recession.""

Silicon Valley

DesJardins noted the abundance of jobs in Silicon Valley, and that if Google were to set up shop in Scotts Valley - nothing official on this -еК that would benefit the local real estate market.

Bailey's conclusion:еК""San Jose is coming, so hang on - the merry-go-round is not stopping.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКEven as Facebook, Google and others confronted challenges in 2018, their ambitions were undimmed. After all, so much of life remains undisrupted.

SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Silicon Valley ended 2018 somewhere it had never been: embattled.

Lawmakers across the political spectrum say Big Tech, for so long the exalted embodiment of American genius, has too much power. Once seen as a force for making our lives better and our brains smarter, tech is now accused of inflaming, radicalizing, dumbing down and squeezing the masses. Tech company stocks have been pummeled from their highs. Regulation looms. Even tech executives are calling for it.

In the face of such a sustained assault, this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low. It could devote some of its mountains of cash -- Apple alone has $237 billion in the bank -- to genuine good works, and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny.

That is not the path the companies are taking.

""The tech companies are not flinching,"" said Bob Staedler, a Silicon Valley consultant. ""Nothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back. Instead, they are expanding. They're going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz-bang thing.""

There is so much of life that remains undisrupted. The companies are competing to own the cloud -- to become, in essence, the internet's landlord. They have designs on cities: Google made a deal in 2017 to reimagine a chunk of waterfront Toronto from the ground up. Amazon is reworking the definition of community from the inside, as warehouses in rural areas provide the urban middle class with everything they want to stay home all weekend.

These changes are only beginning to redefine society. When every home has an Amazon Echo, Google Home, an Apple HomePod or some other smart speaker, the companies are already signaling, all human and metaphysical needs will be fulfilled. For those who insist on venturing out, there will be driverless cars operated by Big Tech. And the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence, with consequences unclear even to them.

To accomplish all this, Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees, which means it needs somewhere to put them. This isn't a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters. It means building new campuses around the country.

Big Tech's push into New York City and the Washington area has been well documented in recent months, with Google bulking up in the first and Amazon planning satellite offices in both. But even in its backyard of Silicon Valley, which is a mess of traffic congestion and housing prices that have attained levels even well-paid engineers can scarcely afford, there is a boom that, if anything, is accelerating.

Anyone who wants to believe Big Tech is chastened should visit a section of San Jose just west of downtown, a jumble of carwashes and auto-body shops with a sprinkling of modern apartments. On a short street there is a house nearly a century old, a tiny thing with only one bath. Google bought it and another house last month in a package deal for $4 million, according to county documents reviewed by The Mercury News.

Multiply that real estate transaction by dozens, big parcels and small, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to date. Google is planning very long term here. The buses, light rail, Caltrain and Amtrak trains that converge on the Diridon Station transit center will give the company an opportunity to embed mass transit into its growth. The eventual result will be a new Google campus of eight million square feet with offices for 20,000 workers, a figure that is more than the company's total employment in 2009.

But Diridon Station is just a part of Google's Silicon Valley expansion. A week before the company got the two houses, it bought a 100,000-square-foot building in Palo Alto, Calif., for $70 million.

Facebook keeps growing, too. In the spring, it leased one million square feet in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale for its fast-growing community operations team, which deals with safety and security issues confronting Facebook users. And it will soon move this year into 750,000 square feet in a San Francisco tower, making it the third-biggest tech tenant in the city, after Salesforce and Uber.

In total, Google's employment increased 21 percent in the last year. Facebook's work force rose by 45 percent in that time, to 34,000, and it is advertising 2,700 additional jobs.

Amazon's head count tripled over the last three years, thanks to its warehouses and the acquisition of Whole Foods. It is only the second company in the United States to employ more than 500,000 people -- and that is not counting its contractors.

The expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech: It is barely getting started.

""For all intents and purposes, we're only 35 years into a 75- or 80-year process of moving from analog to digital,"" said Tim Bajarin, a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple, IBM and Microsoft. ""The image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit, but the reality is that we the consumers are constantly voting for them.""

That's evident in how robust Big Tech's businesses remain. Last March, the research firm eMarketer said Facebook, including its less controversial photo-sharing site, Instagram, would earn $21 billion this year from digital ads in the United States. In September, it raised that forecast to $22.87 billion.

EMarketer also revised up its forecasts of Google's digital ad revenues in the United States for 2018, 2019 and 2020. The third big digital advertising recipient is Amazon, which is far behind the leaders but gaining ground fast.

The contradiction is becoming increasingly obvious. One important way Big Tech serves its customers is by tracking their movements and purchases, which is beginning to unnerve at least some of us. In a Pew Research Center survey in June, 42 percent of adult Facebook users said they had taken a break of several weeks from the site. But even as we say we trust tech less, we invite it deeper into our lives.

Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, Google's parent company, together generated $166.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2018 alone -- up 24 percent from a year earlier, when the four companies hauled in $134.4 billion.

""Much as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide,"" said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Big Tech needs to be regulated, many are beginning to argue, and yet there are worries about giving that power to the government.

""The government doesn't have a good clue,"" said Mr. Bajarin, the consultant. ""They're not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulation.""

Which leaves regulation up to the companies themselves, always a dubious proposition.

""For Facebook to have a better year in 2019, it needs to be more upfront and transparent,"" said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer. This was also the advice Facebook got for 2018, to little avail.

All this could change if the anti-tech mood continues to swell or the economy hits a really rough patch. On the other hand, the last recession tended to work in Big Tech's favor by giving smaller competitors even more to worry about.

During the 2008 financial crisis, Amazon's North American media sales increased 20 percent. Borders, one of its biggest book-selling competitors, saw revenue drop 9 percent, reported a record loss and was soon defunct.

With so little to really worry about, Big Tech is planning for a future far beyond any present-day turmoil. Google, which has 3,500 job openings, says it is too early to say what the thousands of Diridon employees will do. But Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California, has a good idea: everything.

""They're in the transportation business, the medical business, every business,"" said Mr. Taplin, a frequent critic of how Big Tech took over a decentralized, independent internet. ""There is no aspect of your life that they will not be involved in.""

In October, a group of Americans were asked to rank which U.S. institution they trusted the most. Researchers from Georgetown and NYU were curious to see if there was anything left in 2018 that an increasingly polarized public still considered honorable. It wasn't religion, Congress, or the press. The military scored highly, topping the Republican pool's list. But across party lines, one brand secured the broadest allegiance, at least for the 5,400 respondents that took the survey: Amazon.com.

Amazon's high grade-ranked first for Democrats, and third for Republicans-might come as a surprise. On the right, the company has been a frequent target of President Donald Trump's ire. And on the left, it's been condemned for a host of corporate offenses, such as providing ICE with facial recognition technology, treating workers like robots, and union-busting. This year, as Amazon's valuation hit $1 trillion and founder Jeff Bezos officially became the world's richest man, it helped disappear a business tax in Seattle designed to help homeless people and allegedly lobbied hard against toughening Washington state's pay equity law. And yes, this was the year Amazon's North America-wide search for a second headquarters came to an unceremonious close, triggering a national debate about the corporate tax incentives it was allowed to solicit. What to make of this? Not much, perhaps. ""Trust"" isn't the same as ""respect,"" and many of the categories in this survey (like ""nonprofits"") were impossibly vague and broad. Expressing faith in Amazon is more like acknowledging its power and usefulness. And no labor-rights scandal or HQ2 anticlimax could shatter that faith, which is really the same confidence invested in the tech sector itself: It's the idea that the minds and machines of Silicon Valley collectively represent the most agile problem-solver of our age. Amazon arguably plays this game better than anyone, betting that by making shopping, eating, and watching TV easier for individuals, it can also prove it's a force for good in communities. Yes, this is a company that has reportedly patented a wrist-tracker to limit workers' bathroom time, but damn, that two-day shipping is convenient! (How much do we trust Amazon? Many millions of us are happy to install the company's always-listening voice-robots in our most intimate private spaces.) In Seattle, even as Amazon takes heat for widening inequality and fueling a homelessness crisis, it's praised for reinvigorating the economy and rebranding the city in a shimmer of cool. Politicians there are loathe to alienate it. Though the survey was conducted before November's big reveal of HQs 2 and 3, that saga can be read in the context of trust, too. Amazon managed to convince 238 cities and states and municipalities to participate in a pretend competition that they should properly have identified as a tragicomic grift from the beginning. You can't really blame them. Research out of the Brookings Institution shows that the bulk of post-recession employment gains since the recession have been concentrated in just 2 percent of the United States, and that ""the same top 10 metros captured almost have of the new tech jobs created from 2015 to 2017."" In its Request for Proposals, Amazon implied that cities everywhere would truly be considered on their merits. City and state leaders nationwide got caught up in the thrilling notion that a tech superpower could sweep in and transform their economies with 50,000 jobs. So did the media tasked with covering their bids: Here at CityLab, the Amazon HQ2 desk churned out about 40 posts chronicling the competition. The bid I think about most is Kansas City's. In October 2017, its then-mayor, Sly James, bought 1,000 Amazon products, rated each 5 stars, and wrote reviews for every one, with earnestly crafted Kansas City-themed quips. ""Here in KC, we're ranked as one of the 20 Happiest Cities to Work in Right Now,"" the mayor commented on the children's book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. ""[S]o lucky for us, the chance of having a Terrible, Horrible, Very Bad Day at work is less."" He couldn't offer to funnel Amazon employees' income taxes back to the company, like Chicago did, or to let the company control what projects its tax dollars funded, like Fresno did, or just hand over $8.5 billion, like Maryland did. His was a simple, good faith ploy. When 20 finalist cities were chosen by Amazon in January 2018, Kansas City didn't make the list. Neither did Danbury, Connecticut; or Pomona, California; or Frisco, Texas, whose mayors all produced pleading videos dismissed as ""embarrassing"" by the Washington Post. The finalists were, instead, the usual suspects: American ""superstars,"" with a few wild cards thrown in, plus Toronto. In the end, the company split the 50,000-job prize in half, and picked two of the most obvious places in the country to share it. So, after 14 months of discourse around the company's lack of transparency, the shadiness of the non-disclosure agreements it asked city and state leaders to sign, and the fundamental outrageousness of giving public money to a company owned by the wealthiest soul on the planet, what did we learn? For one thing, the decision confirmed the conventional wisdom that the sweepstakes was meant to upend. The key factors in these type of decisions aren't tax incentives or promotional videos-they're features like usable public transit systems and vibrant urban centers. Hosting several thousand employees of the interested company already also helps. Tech settles with tech; the rich get richer; and everyone else gets left behind. As Emily Badger wrote in the New York Times, the HQ2 hunt revealed the ""deepening suspicion of many communities that the costs of urban prosperity outweigh the benefits."" The choice was also a relief, for some. With only 25,000 workers each, the new HQs will be more glorified office expansions than full-fledged satellite campuses. Their housing markets will be better prepared to handle the influx. Long Island City has developed real estate faster than any other New York borough this year, and Crystal City's most pressing urban problem is its vast swaths of empty office space. The D.C. region has grown by the equivalent of 12 Amazons since 2000, according to the D.C. Policy Center, adding an average of 34,000 people per year. New York has added an average of about 64,000 a year since 2010. Amazon's 25,000 workers-many of them sourced from within the region, and others moving in slowly-might not make a cosmic dent. That's been little consolation for the immigrant communities in Long Island City who fear that rents will rise and policing will become more oppressive. Nor residents of the Queensbridge House, the nation's largest public housing development, which will soon be Amazon's forgotten neighbor. And especially not for the many low-wage workers in both New York and D.C. that have already been priced out of job-rich areas. For them, the damage from the region's inequitable growth has already been done. As Alex Baca wrote in Vox, Amazon is merely exposing what's been true for decades: that accessible, affordable housing; frequent, reliable transit; well-protected jobs that pay living wages; and land use laws that support environmentally sustainable growth are talking points, but not necessarily priorities for elected officials. [The D.C.] region needed these fundamentals long before HQ2 was a twinkle in anyone's eye, and would need them whether or not Amazon existed. The first part of change, to be fair, is admitting that it's needed. Some cities took their HQ2 rejections as constructive criticism, vowing to take the hint that they need to build more, and better, infrastructure. Amazon might now give the winning cities that push, too. There's another dimension to the downgrade, though: Didn't cities want Amazon's impact to be transformative? Crystal City has lost 17,000 jobs in the past five years to military base realignment, and Long Island City's building boom hasn't been paired with growth fast enough to fill it. Adding 25,000 jobs over the course of almost a decade might not be enough to make any sort of tangible economic impact in these-or many-cities. (The jobs' worth will also be determined by who gets them, and what benefits they'll include.) And, as the stock market teeters and tariffs tighten, no company can predict the hiring decisions of the future. Foxconn already proved in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania that pledging jobs doesn't always mean delivering them. If Amazon hires fewer people, the company will suffer too, getting fewer tax breaks. But what, then, would have been the point of it all? Out of the ashes of 14 months of Amazon-fueled debate, some faint outline of how to do all this better is emerging. New York City leaders are fighting to stall or shrink the incentive packages offered by state leaders; and to eliminate the use of non-disclosure agreements in economic development deals. Nationally, economic experts and legislators have renewed calls to make bidding wars like Amazon's entirely illegal, advocating for the federal government to tax relocation incentives at 100 percent to reduce their power as a negotiating tactic. Rival tech companies, too, now leap at the opportunity to cast themselves as Amazon foils. Apple's choice to build its second campus in Austin, Texas, might further a suburban-urban divide and cultivate auto use, but at least they can say they only got around $25 million from the deal. Google's agreement to build a campus in San Jose involves no tax incentives at all, and might even include a mandate to build affordable housing downtown. (It's been more quiet about its downtown expansion in New York, which could net it at least $150 million in handouts.) The new focus on promising harm-reduction along with expansion might not do much to repair the already-fraught relationship between tech and the people of the Bay Area. There, the dynamic is already ""framed as us-versus-them,"" Catherine Bracy, the co-founder and executive director of the Bay Area-based tech organizing group TechEquity Collaborative, told me last month. Tech is seen as ""the interloper, and the cause of all of our problems."" Amazon's expansion in Virginia and New York gives it a unique opportunity to forge a new image of what a tech company does in a city. A lot of people will be watching. The company has promised measures that, if faithfully executed, could preempt some of its predicted negative effects-implementing programs to encourage public transportation use for Virginia employees; and connecting New York City public housing residents with tech training programs. It will build a public school in Long Island City. Bezos won't return his New York State tax breaks, but New York's city council might not give him his helipad.

In the wake of HQ2, cities can also start setting their own terms for economic symbiosis. In November, both San Francisco and Mountain View passed contentious taxes on their tech-heavy business sector to fund homelessness initiatives, succeeding where Seattle failed. Other places are choosing to focus less on tech-dominant growth-not for any higher moral reason, necessarily, just because they've found (or have been forced to look for) other paths. Towns in rural Michigan are building smaller-scale tech accelerators, to train up a workforce where the public school system has failed. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, the city will try paying individual freelancers to move to their city, hoping to spur local entrepreneurship. But it's not clear that this represents a paradigm shift for tech-driven economies, and for the tech companies that drive them. Our enduring faith in the Amazons of the world can't be underestimated. Between November and December of 2018, Quinnipiac University asked a group of about 1,000 registered New York City voters to share their thoughts on the impending Amazon move. When the results were tallied, a little less than half approved of the incentives offered, and even fewer expressed support for Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo. But more than half of the people surveyed approved of the move.",222,The Associated Press,26-Dec-18,Gofundme Refunds All Donors In Homeless Man Scam,322,The Mercury News (california),,"Gofundme Refunds All Donors In Homeless Man Scam

HIGHLIGHT:еКGoFundMe says it has refunded everyone who contributed to a campaign involving a homeless veteran from Philadelphia who prosecutors allege schemed with a New Jersey couple to scam donors out of more than $400,000.

MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) - GoFundMe says it has refunded everyone who contributed to a campaign involving a homeless veteran from Philadelphia who prosecutors allege schemed with a New Jersey couple to scam donors out of more than $400,000.

GoFundMe spokesman Bobby Whithorne said Tuesday that all donors who contributed to this GoFundMe campaign have been fully refunded and the organization is cooperating fully with law enforcement.

Burlington County prosecutors allege in a criminal complaint that Johnny Bobbitt conspired with Katelyn McClure and her boyfriend at the time, Mark DAmico, to concoct a feel-good story about Bobbitt giving McClure his last $20 when her car ran out of gas. They raised $400,000, which authorities say was spent on luxury items and casino trips.

Whithorne said campaigns involving misuse make up less than one tenth of one percent of all GoFundMe campaigns, but such behavior is unacceptable and has consequences.

We have a zero tolerance policy for fraudulent behavior, he said. If fraud occurs, donors get refunded and we work with law enforcement officials to recover the money.

McClure has alleged through her lawyer that DAmico duped her. His lawyer has denied the allegations. Prosecutors released texts from McClure including one sent right after the GoFundMe page was set up in which they allege she told a friend that the gas part is completely made up.

Prosecutors began investigating last summer after Bobbitt said he wasnt getting money raised on his behalf. He later sued the couple.

Don't start crying in your Hurricane or rushing for a last po' boy at Poor House Bistro.

Google purchased the land beneath the popular New Orleans-themed restaurant and music venue in downtown San Jose, but owner Jay Meduri says that doesn't mean it's time to say bye-bye to beignets.

Poor House Bistro opened in 2005 in the century-old home that belonged to Meduri's family. He lived in it for a few years in the 1990s before getting permission from his mother, Sally Meduri, who has since passed away, to turn it into a restaurant and live music venue.

HIGHLIGHT:еКActivists opposing plans for Google's downtown San Jose campus are drawing attention to a sharp rise in homeless deaths in recent years, with at least 135 deaths in Santa Clara County so far in 2018.

SAN JOSE - Activists opposed to Google's plan for a downtown San Jose campus showed up at one of the search company's newly acquired parcels Wednesday morning to flag attention to the plight of people who will be displaced and a sharp rise in homeless deaths.

""In San Jose, they have money and the resources for what they want and projects that make people rich, (but they're) failing the most vulnerable and the poorest,"" the Rev. Scott Wagers, a pastor for the CHAM Deliverance Ministry, said at a press conference Wednesday in front of property recently purchased by Google at the corner of San Fernando and Autumn streets.

""People on the street feel totally abandoned because you look around and see all the wealth,"" Wagers said.

Wagers noted that while the city is seemingly preoccupied with helping Google advance its plans, he doesn't believe there is as much urgency in helping the powerless.

At least 135 homeless people died in Santa Clara so far this year, according to figures by the Santa Clara County Coroner. A 2017 report by the Santa Clara County Coroner found homeless deaths increased 164 percent, from 50 in 2011 to 132 deaths in 2016.

According to the coroner, 157 homeless people died in 2017.

Wagers and activists with Serve the People San Jose and the Affordable Housing Network of Santa Clara County say their public records request for deaths between December 2017 and November 2018 showed 157 deaths over that period.

Living without reliable shelter has major impacts on one's health and life expectancy. The chronically homeless have an estimated lifespan of 42 to 52 years, compared to 78 years for the general population, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless.

Ramon Navarro Johnson, 59, has been homeless several times since high school. He sees the sale of city-owned land to Google as a bellwether for the region's economically vulnerable.

""Property values are going to go up, and the disabled like myself are going to be priced out,"" said Johnson.

At the press conference, he and other activists called on Google to cancel its plan for the 50-acre transit village and donate the properties to a community trust dedicated to affordable housing..

Wagers said while the city has housing projects in the pipeline, it isn't acting quickly enough to help people suffering in the meantime.

""The pipeline is not going to save lives,"" Wagers said, adding that Google properties should be used as temporary, sanctioned encampments.

A city-commissioned study estimates the development will generate 25,000 new jobs, a 65 percent increase in the number of workers in downtown San Jose.

Google has said the project will include community benefits, which would be hammered out in a development agreement between the city and company.

The company has also contributed $15.5 million to San Jose nonprofits since 2014.

""We remain open to discussions with city staff on how Google resources could be used to support the community,"" said Javier Gonzalez, Google's public policy manager for the South Bay. ""While those conversations are happening, we'll continue to work with local non-profit partners like PATH, Downtown Streets Team, Destination Home, and more, who focus on aiding the homeless in San Jose and the greater Bay Area.""

On Tuesday, the San Jose City Council approved two sites to build 80 tiny homes, which would serve as temporary shelters for homeless people while they wait for a permanent place to live.

Although city representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment,еКthey previously have noted community benefits to be paid for by Google will include affordable housing.

NEW YORK CITY -- Silicon Valley is becoming Silicon Nation.

Google is planning a major expansion in New York City, announcing Monday it will spend more than $1 billion on a new office complex that will allow the internet search giant to double the number of people it employs there.

The move follows similar steps by Amazon and Apple to set up operations well outside their home areas. Hungry for engineers and other employees, tech companies are aggressively expanding beyond the Seattle-San Francisco corridor.

The Northeast is proving to be a good match, with its large concentration of highly educated young people from Boston to New York.

Google, based in Mountain View, California, will fashion a complex exceeding 1.7 million square feet along the Hudson River in the city's West Village neighborhood, Ruth Porat, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said in a blog post.

Google opened its first office in New York nearly 20 years ago and now employs 7,000 people in the city. Its footprint has expanded continuously. Google said this year that it would buy the Manhattan Chelsea Market building for $2.4 billion and planned to lease more space at Pier 57, both along the Hudson about a mile north of the newly announced complex.

A month ago, Seattle-based Amazon said it would set up new headquarters in New York's Long Island City neighborhood and in Arlington, Virginia, creating upwards of 25,000 jobs in each location.

U.S. homebuilder optimism dips to weakest level in 3 years

Sentiment among U.S. homebuilders fell in December to the lowest level since 2015, missing all forecasts and signaling that the industry's struggles are intensifying amid elevated prices and higher borrowing costs.

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped to 56 from 60 in the prior month amid broad-based declines across sales, expectations and buyer traffic, data released Monday showed. The median estimate in Bloomberg's survey had called for it to hold at 60. With November's eight-point decrease, it was the biggest two-month decline since October 2001.

The waning optimism among builders underscores concern that housing - an industry that's sensitive to borrowing costs - is at risk of slipping into a more pronounced slowdown. The Federal Reserve is widely projected to raise interest rates this week for the fourth time in 2018; borrowing costs recently hit a seven-year high after years of strong property-price gains.

The decline in builder sentiment follows a report earlier on Monday that showed a sharp slowdown in business at New York-area factories. The New York Fed's Empire State manufacturing index tumbled in December to a 19-month low, adding to signs U.S. economic growth is moderating and bolstering the case for the central bank to be more cautious on interest-rate hikes next year.

""We are hearing from builders that consumer demand exists, but that customers are hesitating to make a purchase because of rising home costs,"" NAHB Chairman Randy Noel, a custom-home builder from Louisiana, said in a statement. ""However, recent declines in mortgage interest rates should help move the market forward in early 2019.""

Silicon Valley East: Google plans $1B expansion in NYC

Google announced Monday it will spend more than $1 billion to build a new office complex in New York City that will allow the internet search giant to double the number of people it employs there.

It is the tech industry's latest major expansion beyond the Seattle-San Francisco Bay corridor. It follows recent steps by Amazon and Apple to set up operations well outside their home areas.

Tech companies are ""coming to the realization that the Bay Area, which has traditionally been the major center of tech activity in the U.S., is getting expensive and crowded,"" said Andrew Bartels, principal analyst at Forrester Research.

""A lot of vendors are coming to the realization that 'We can probably find top talent elsewhere at a more affordable costs, and perhaps a better style of life for employees who may be struggling to make ends meet.'""

The Northeast is proving to be a good match, with its large concentration of highly educated young people. New York in particular boasts key qualities, including proximity to the financial industry, a large base of existing tech workers, and the second-largest concentration of tech startups behind the Bay Area, Bartels said.

Google, based in Mountain View, California, will fashion a complex exceeding 1.7 million square feet along the Hudson River in the city's West Village neighborhood, Ruth Porat, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said in a blog post.

HIGHLIGHT:еКUpping the ante in the competition for Big Apple talent, Google plans to build a 1.7 million-square-foot complex by the Hudson River on West St. from Spring St. to Houston St. And unlike fellow tech titan Amazon, Google says it didn't demand tax breaks in the latest deal.daily news photo illustration

Google-zilla is expanding its Manhattan footprint with a $1 billion expansion that will swallow up a big swath of the far West Village and double its Big Apple workforce.

Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., will build a complex of more than 1.7 million square feet along the Hudson River across West St. from Pier 40, Ruth Porat, senior vice president and chief financial officer at Google and its parent company Alphabet, said in a blog post.

""New York City continues to be a great source of diverse, world-class talent - that's what brought Google to the city in 2000 and that's what keeps us here,"" she said.

Porat said Google Hudson Square will be a product of lease agreements at 315 and 345 Hudson St., and a signed letter of intent for a lease at 550 Washington St. - a campus that would stretch from Spring St. near the Holland Tunnel north to Houston St.

The expansion - the latest high-tech move from Silicon Valley to the East Coast - builds on the company's announcement earlier this year that it planned a $2.4 billion purchase of the Chelsea Market building in the Meatpacking District.

Google established its first New York presence nearly 20 years ago with a single salesperson operating out of a Starbucks.

The company has since grown in the city to 7,000 employees who speak 50 languages and work on a broad range of teams handling searches, maps, YouTube, sales and research. The company hopes to move into the Hudson Square campus by 2020.

""New York City continues to be a great source of diverse, world-class talent - that's what brought Google to the city in 2000 and that's what keeps us here,"" Porat wrote.

This year Google has opened new offices and data centers in Detroit, Boulder, Colo., Los Angeles, Tennessee and Alabama.

""In fact, we're growing faster outside the Bay Area than within it,"" Porat said.

She added that Google will have the ""capacity to more than double the number of Googlers"" in New York over the next 10 years.

""As we continue to grow across the country, we look forward to calling New York City home for many years to come,"" she said.

Porat telegraphed Google's plans to double down in New York a month ago during a technology conference.

""Not everybody - big surprise - wants to live in Silicon Valley, so we want to make sure we have the opportunity to build vibrant centers across the country,"" she said.

Mayor de Blasio welcomed the announcement..

""Big news: Google's latest expansion #inManhattan will mean more jobs and more opportunity for New Yorkers. It's our talent and diversity that makes us the top destination for tech companies,"" de Blasio tweeted Monday.

The announcement comes just weeks after retail giant Amazon announced that it would set up an office complex in Long Island City, and bring with it a boatload of jobs.

The Seattle-based company said it would set up new headquarters in the Queens neighborhood and in Arlington, Va., creating up to 25,000 jobs in each location.

Facebook, based in Menlo Park, Calif., has over 2,000 employees in New York.

Executives said the Northeast is increasingly more attractive to tech companies because it has a strong base of higher education and a concentration of young, educated workers from Boston to Brooklyn.

Google, meanwhile, recently agreed to pay more than $100 million for a swath of land in downtown San Jose, Calif., for a big new campus that will include employee housing. Earlier this year, Google opened offices and data centers in Detroit, Los Angeles, Boulder, Colorado, Tennessee and Alabama.

Unlike Amazon's move, Google's New York expansion plans did not include any public competition between cities.

The company also said it did not pursue or receive any tax incentives as part of its new expansion. There has also been no community outrage or protests.

""We believe that as our company grows, we have a responsibility to support the communities we call home,"" Porat said in the post. ""That means supporting the infrastructure and services that make our neighborhoods unique places to work, live and play.""",230,Mae Anderson Associated Press,18-Dec-18,Google Plans $1b Expansion In Nyc,433,Southern Illinoisan (il),A; Pg. 008,"Google Plans $1b Expansion In Nyc

Porat said that the company's most recent investments give it the ability to more than double the number of Google employees in New York over the next 10 years.",231,,17-Dec-18,Google Says New Campus Will Result In Doubling Of New York Workforce,562,Big News Network.com,,"Google Says New Campus Will Result In Doubling Of New York Workforce

SAN JOSE, California - Google Hudson Square is coming to New York City, with an attaching price tag of more than a billion dollars.

Google&#39s parent Alphabet Inc., is following in the footsteps of Amazon in choosing NYC to build a new campus.

ComprisingеК1.7 million square-feet, the megaеКcampusеКwill include leased properties at Hudson Street and Washington Street.

""Today we're taking the next step in our commitment to our New York City presence by investing over $1 billion in capital improvements to establish a new campus, Google Hudson Square,"" Ruth Porat, Senior Vice President andеКChief Financial Officer of Alphabet and GoogleеКsaid in a company blog on Monday.

""We came to New York City almost two decades ago, it was our first office outside of California. It's now home to more than 7,000 employees, speaking 50 languages, working on a broad range of teams including Search, Ads, Maps, YouTube, Cloud, Technical Infrastructure, Sales, Partnerships and Research.""

""New York City continues to be a great source of diverse, world-class talent, that's what brought Google to the city in 2000 and that's what keeps us here,"" Porat said. ""Earlier this year, we announced the $2.4 billionеКpurchase of the Manhattan Chelsea MarketеКand shared plans toеКlease additional space at Pier 57. We hope to start moving into the two Hudson Street buildings by 2020, followed by 550 Washington Street in 2022 once the building is complete. Google Hudson Square will be the primary location for our New York-based Global Business Organization.""

""We believe that as our company grows, we have a responsibility to support the communities we call home. That means supporting the infrastructure and services that make our neighborhoods unique places to work, live and play,"" said the GoogleеКSVP and CFO. ""Since 2011, Google has contributed more than $150 million in grants and employee-matched giving to New York nonprofit institutions. We've been ardent supporters of iconic neighborhood public resources such as the High Line and Hudson River Park, and partnered with theеКNew York City Public Library SystemеКto provide free Wi-Fi hotspots to public school students and families without home internet access. We recently donated $1.5 million to support the Stonewall National Monument Preservation ProjectеКand joined forces with 19 local businesses to establish theеКWestside Community Fund. And to help foster New York's burgeoning tech ecosystem, we've funded programs likeеКMotherCoders NYC, provided space to organizations like Black Girls Code andеКhosted Cornell Tech while its permanent campus on Roosevelt Island was under construction.""

Google has promised to deepen itsеКcommitments in STEM education, workforce development and access to technology.

With its most recent investments in Google Chelsea and Google Hudson Square, the company says it will have the capacity to more than double the number of Googlers in New York over the next 10 years.

""Our investment in New York is a huge part of our commitment to grow and invest in U.S. facilities, offices and jobs. In fact, we're growing faster outside the Bay Area than within it, and this year opened new offices and data centers in locations like Detroit, Boulder, Los Angeles, Tennessee and Alabama. And as we continue to grow across the country, we look forward to calling New York City home for many years to come,"" Porat said.",232,Levi Sumagaysay,17-Dec-18,"New York City? Google Spending $1 Billion On A New Campus, Too",464,The East Bay Times (california),,"New York City? Google Spending $1 Billion On A New Campus, Too

HIGHLIGHT:еКAs U.S. tech giants race to proclaim their economic contributions to the nation, Google's announcement comes on the heels of those by Apple and Amazon, which are also expanding beyond the West Coast.

Amazon did it, Apple did it and now its Googles turn: It has announced a massive new campus outside its West Coast home base.

Google is spending $1 billion on capital improvements to 1.7 million square feet of buildings it is leasing in New York City, which could over the next decade hold more than double the 7,000 workers the company has in that city now, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in a blog post Monday.

New York City continues to be a great source of diverse, world-class talent - that's what brought Google to the city in 2000 and that's what keeps us here, Porat wrote. Googles new Hudson Square campus, which will include a central office space on Washington Street and additional spaces on Hudson Street in Manhattan, will be the base for the companys global business operations, she said.

U.S. tech giants are rushing to proclaim their economic contributions to the nation amid political pressure from President Donald Trump over jobs and as lawmakers consider regulating the tech industry.

Our investment in New York is a huge part of our commitment to grow and invest in U.S. facilities, offices and jobs, Porat said, touting the companys contributions to that city throughout the years. Google expects to move employees into the Hudson Street sites by 2020, and the Washington Street offices by 2022.

Porat also noted that Google is growing faster outside the Bay Area than within it, mentioning that the company this year openedеКnew offices and data centers in Detroit, Boulder, Los Angeles, Tennessee and Alabama. In addition, Googles plans for a transit village in San Jose are expected to transform that citys downtown. Also last month, the company bought a $1 billion business park in Mountain View just blocks from its headquarters, and last week unveiled big redevelopment plans for northern Mountain View.

Last week, Apple announced it would build a new, $1 billion campus in Austin and open new offices in San Diego, Culver City and Seattle over the next few years. That followed Amazons announcement last month of its choice for its second headquarters, New York City and Arlington, Virginia.

Tech companies are heading east in droves, seeking brainy computer engineers and tax breaks from cities hungry for high-paying jobs. Are Silicon Valley companies abandoning their roots?

[ibd-display-video id=3897384 width=50 float=left autostart=true]

Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area, is stepping up investment in New York City. Google on Dec. 17 announced it'll spend $1 billion on a New York campus to house global business operations.

Another Silicon Valley icon,еКApple (AAPL), disclosed on Dec. 14 that it's building a new facility in Austin, Texas, with a potential capacity for 15,000 jobs. Apple also plans to add jobs in other locations east of its current home. Meanwhile, Seattle-based Amazon.com (AMZN) has divvied up its second headquarters, called HQ2, between New York City and a location near Washington, D.C., in northern Virginia.

But make no mistakeеК-- this is an expansion, not an exodus, experts say. Tech companies are looking all over the U.S. for places to house new facilities, not just East Coast urban centers, as evidenced by Apple.

And contrary to some reports, the sidewalks in Silicon Valley, as well as the tech-heavy Seattle region up the coast, won't be rolling up anytime soon. Splashy new headquarters are rising on the West Coast, and tech companies are scouring the region for places where they can expand.

[investors-newsletters-signup /]

""We just had the greatest decade of tech expansion and urban growth in history here, so doomsday saying seems a bit premature,"" said Richard Walker, a professor emeritus of geography at University of California at Berkeley. ""There is a common misconception that costs will drive away tech companies from the Bay Area, but costs are driven themselves by the demand to be in this metropolitan area -- so the argument is circular and wrong.""

What's really behind the moves east? Some say tech companies are building up a presence near the country's financial and political centers of power -- Wall Street and Capitol Hill. And indeed, the moves come as regulators and lawmakers put some of the companies' business models under a microscope.

On A Quest For Talent

The biggest reason, analysts say, is a talent hunt.еКAmazon, Google and Apple could add some 100,000 tech jobs at eastern locations over the next several years.еКSalesforce.com (CRM), a leader in selling software services to big businesses, in 2016 moved into Verizon Communications' (VZ) former headquarters in mid-Manhattan. Look west from mid-Manhattan's New York Public Library and the Salesforce logo stands out near Times Square.

""Talent is at the top of the list of things tech companies are looking for when deciding where to locate and expand their operations. (Washington and New York) have deep pools of tech talent,"" Moody's economist Mark Zandi said in an email.

By heading east, tech firms aim to recruit top talent in millennial-friendly urban locations. Along with that, venture capital funding of startups has soared in New York, and the tech giants are paying attention. With their workers mingling with startups in the Big Apple's social scene, the tech giants have a better chance of investing in or acquiring up-and-coming companies.

On the face of it, tech companies' moves to Washington, D.C., appear aimed at self-preservation when it comes to Congress and regulators. Google andеКFacebook (FB) face a backlash over consumer privacy that could undermine their digital advertising businesses. Amazon's torrid growth has spurred speculation it could be targeted on antitrust grounds.

""Locating operations in more places also helps with tech companies' political influence, particularly in the D.C. area, as it gives them more of a voice in Congress and key government agencies,"" said Zandi.

Others disagree.еК""I seriously doubt that the location near Washington, D.C., was driven by politics,"" said Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Gallant in an interview. ""It's an easy and obvious inference, but we underappreciate Amazon's focus on obtaining top tech talent with this HQ2 decision. I think access to policy makers was probably a marginal factor or an incremental plus in the D.C. location.""

Competition For Technology Companies

Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at online realtor Zillow (Z), says the race is on to become the nation's second-biggest technology hub behind Silicon Valley. Seattle, the Boston area, Denver and Austin already stand out as tech hubs.

With Amazon and Google expanding in the Big Apple, New York should be on its way to the top tier. Facebook, Spotify (SPOT) and other tech companies also are expanding in New York.

""A lot of different parts of the country are going to argue they're No. 2 to Silicon Valley and the Bay area,"" Terrazas said. ""That speaks to the continued pre-eminence of the Bay area.""

Amazon stands to get up to $2.2 billion in incentives from New York and Virginia. The e-commerce giant plans to add 25,000 jobs in each market over two decades. In New York, Amazon already has nearly 2,000 workers, including advertising staff.

Google, meanwhile, has 7,000 employees in Manhattan. Google says its newеКHudson Square campus, which will house global business operations, will bring its Big Apple workforce to at least 15,000 over the next decade.еКThe internet search giant in March also bought the Manhattan Chelsea Market for $2.4 billion.

Tech Companies In New York And Other Cities

Aside from being a new residence for Amazon and Google, New York aspires to be the birthplace of the next tech behemoth.

In the June 2018 quarter, total venture capital investment in New York City jumped 28% to $2.97 billion. New York has produced public companies such as Blue Apron (APRN), Etsy (ETSY) and MongoDB (MDB).

A new tech-focused campus jointly run by Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology recently opened on Roosevelt Island, near Manhattan.

But New York faces competition, and not just from the West Coast. While New York City and northern Virginia have been in the spotlight, big Silicon Valley companies also are adding tech jobs in other locations.

Areas with top universities have the best chance of attracting tech companies. Apple, Facebook, Google and Uber Technologies have a growing presence in Pittsburgh, which has Carnegie Mellon and other institutions. Pittsburgh has emerged as one hub for artificial intelligence research.

According to Brookings Institution, cities like Dallas, Phoenix and Indianapolis are among the cities adding the most jobs for tech companies.

""The most Silicon-Valley-like places are Boston, Austin and Seattle, as well as smaller markets like Provo, Utah; and Boulder, Colo.,""еКsaid Jed Kolko, chief economist at job search websiteеКIndeed.com.

Apple Expands In Austin, Texas

Apple's announcement this week illustrates the point.еКThe tech icon on Dec. 13 said it plans to spend $1 billion to expand its Austin operations with a new 133-acre campus a mile away from existing facilities. It will initially accommodate 5,000 more employees and have the capacity to grow to 15,000.

Apple also plans to establish new facilities in Seattle and San Diego. Apple also said it will expand operations in Pittsburgh, Boulder, and Culver City, Calif.

Contrary to reports, Apple's expansion plans apparently do not currently include North Carolina's Research Triangle Park area.

Apple's campus in Austin already has more than 6,000 employees. It started out with technical support operations. But Apple later hired engineering staff to design chips for iPhones.

Unlike Amazon, Apple pursued a new campus location without a high-profile bidding process.

Why Silicon Valley Companies Stay -- And Expand

Still, Silicon Valley holds big advantages, even against other urban areas. While the tech industry's nerve center is beset by high living costs, traffic congestion and other woes,еКrents are higher in New York. The Big Apple shares many of the other drawbacks of San Francisco and the surrounding area.

Plus, Silicon Valley has the educational infrastructure to retain higher-paying, cutting-edge information technology jobs. Many of the East Coast slots could end up beingеКin marketing, customer support and administration.

Silicon Valley still offers the benefit of clustering for tech companies. The San Francisco Bay Area's unique work environments, universities and ecosystem for startups continue to drive innovation. Tech companies get a lift from having customers, business partners and suppliers nearby.

Most ""cutting-edge, higher-paying tech jobs"" are staying in the Bay area, Indeed.com's Kolko told IBD.еКThe most recent government data show that the Bay Area's share of national income continues to climb, he says.

""It's premature to declare 'peak Valley',"" Kolko told IBD. ""To be sure, the high cost of living eats up much of the higher salaries, but the opportunities in the leading tech companies and in the range of startups are hard to match elsewhere.""

Trophy Headquarters As Recruitment Tools

The most prominent sign that tech companies still consider Silicon Valley essential to their future is the sudden splurge onеКnew trophy headquarters. These sparkling new buildings trumpet their success in the digital economy.

The new headquarters, with worker-friendly features, act as recruitment tools, notes LouiseеКMozingo, professor of landscape architecture and environmental planning at UC Berkeley.

There's Apple's $5 billion, ""spaceship"" headquarters in Cupertino. Designed by Norman Foster, the campus opened in 2017. Facebook opened the doors to its new Menlo Park headquarters, designed by Frank Gehry, in September.

Google is building a new Mountain View home base designed by Danish firm BIG. Cesar Pelli's firm designed the $1 billion, 61-story Salesforce Tower in San Francisco, which opened in 2018.

A young computer scientist might have a tough choice between working in one of these Silicon Valley region architectural gems or for a startup in a bland, boxlike office building,еКsays Mozingo.

""If someone is looking for a sense of corporate stability, an impressive headquarters can be very attractive,"" she said. ""The idea of working there confirms your own status and talent and vision of yourself.""

Growth In Silicon Valley And Seattle

Meanwhile, Google and Apple are expanding into new parts of Silicon Valley. Google on Nov. 27 confirmed it's buying a 52-acre business park next to its Mountain View headquarters for $1 billion. Google also aims to build a new campus in San Jose and is in talks with city officials.

With 8 million square feet of office space, the San Jose campus could host up to 20,000 employees by 2025. Google also is adding a campus in Sunnyvale's Moffett Park for up to 4,500 workers.

Apple has added office space in northern San Jose. The iPhone maker is also expanding in nearby Sunnyvale, where Facebook and Amazon have recently signed leasing deals for office space, says Green Street Advisors.

The story is similar in the Pacific Northwest.еКIn Seattle's downtown, Amazon built a new ""biosphere"" headquarters with an artificial rain forest ecosystem. Completed in early 2018, it's next door to a new skyscraper. There, Amazon is expected to take all the office space after it opens in 2020. Amazon has some 45,000 jobs in Seattle and will add more.

The e-commerce giant has been mum on whether Amazon's second headquarters will make a similar architectural statement. Amazon has stated plans to invest $5 billion between Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, and Crystal City, Va.

Also in the Seattle area, Microsoft (MSFT) has announced plans to expand its Redmond, Wash., headquarters for an additional 8,000 to 10,000 jobs by 2024.

Tech Jobs In San Francisco

Newer tech players also see the value of the West Coast. Zillow's Terrazas says many tech companies and startups have shifted to San Francisco. The reason is it allows higher density buildings than most of Silicon Valley. As a result, there's more office space at a lower price.

Salesforce's move into the gleaming new skyscraper bearing its name is just one example,еКsays Green Street Advisors, which tracks commercial real estate. Twitter (TWTR), Facebook, Amazon, Airbnb and Dropbox (DBX) are among companies that have signed large office space leases in San Francisco.

The business climate on the West Coast, though, could be getting tougher.

Seattle recently hit companies with a ""head tax"" on employees. The city repealed the measure amid opposition from Amazon and Starbucks (SBX).

San Francisco in November passed a business tax to fund homeless relief. Parts of Silicon Valley could follow suit.

Google announced Monday it will spend more than $1billion to build a new office complex in New York City that will allow the internet search giant to double the number of people it employs there.

It is the tech industry's latest major expansion beyond the Seattle-San Francisco Bay corridor. It follows recent steps by Amazon and Apple to set up operations well outside their home areas.

However, Google said it has not applied for subsidies or tax incentives for any of its properties in New York, unlike Amazon, which has been offered $2.8billion in tax breaks for the company which surpassed a $1trillion valuation in September.

Google opened its first office in New York nearly 20 years ago and now employs 7,000 people in the city.

With the opening of their new campus in Manhattan, the company will double their workforce to 14,000 over the next decade. Amazon has plans on creating 25,000 jobs once its offices open in Queens.

But there are concerns over tech companies moving into the Big Apple, including the city's already crumbling infrastructure and the housing crisis.

According to Vox, it doesn't actually make sense for the companies like Amazon to add major campuses to New York because the companies' presence will tend to exacerbate the city's crises of housing affordability and overburdened transportation infrastructure.

Those concerns were brought up just last week by council members who met with Amazon executives.

'We have a crumbling subway system, record homelessness, public housing that is in crisis, overcrowded schools, sick people without health insurance and an escalating affordable crisis,' City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, said during the meeting.

'Is anyone asking if we should be giving nearly $3billion in public money to the world's richest company?'

However Amazon claims that the move will majorly help residents by injecting 'over $186billion in positive economic impact' during the course of a quarter of a century.

It's something Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio agree with as it's that said by splitting HQ2 between Arlington, Virginia and the Big Apple, 25,000 jobs will be created in the latter location over a decade.

But the Council questioned why they weren't consulted about a project of this size and many believe that despite promises made by Amazon, they may not benefit the city which is set to rise in population by 131,000.

Tech companies are 'coming to the realization that the Bay Area, which has traditionally been the major center of tech activity in the US, is getting expensive and crowded,' said Andrew Bartels, principal analyst at Forrester Research.

'A lot of vendors are coming to the realization that 'We can probably find top talent elsewhere at a more affordable costs, and perhaps a better style of life for employees who may be struggling to make ends meet.'

The Northeast is proving to be a good match, with its large concentration of highly educated young people.

New York in particular boasts key qualities, including proximity to the financial industry, a large base of existing tech workers, and the second-largest concentration of tech startups behind the Bay Area, Bartels said.

Google said this year that it would buy the Manhattan Chelsea Market building for $2.4billion and planned to lease more space at Pier 57, both along the Hudson about a mile north of the newly announced complex.

The tech-giant, based in Mountain View, California, will fashion a complex exceeding 1.7 million square feet along the Hudson River in the city's West Village neighborhood, Ruth Porat, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said in a blog post.

A month ago, Seattle-based Amazon said it would set up new headquarters in New York's Long Island City neighborhood and in Arlington, Virginia, creating upwards of 25,000 jobs in each location.

But it's not just the East Coast that is benefiting from the expansion.

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, said last week that it plans to build a $1billion campus in Austin, Texas, that will create at least 5,000 jobs.

And Google is expanding elsewhere, too. It plans to develop a 50-acre area into offices, homes, shops, restaurants and parks in San Jose, California, the heart of Silicon Valley.

And this year Google opened new offices and data centers in cities including Detroit; Boulder, Colorado; and Los Angeles, as well as in such states as Tennessee and Alabama.

The bidding for programmers is driving salaries higher, which in turn is catapulting the average prices of homes in many parts of the San Francisco Bay Area above $1million.

Many high-tech workers are choosing to live elsewhere, forcing major tech employers to look in new places for the employees they need.

Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, has more than 2,000 employees in New York.

Google hopes to move into the new campus by 2020.

Porat said that the company's most recent investments give it the ability to more than double the number of Google employees in New York over the next 10 years.

Tech companies see New York as a way to gain a new perspective, one that is different from that of Silicon Valley, which can be seen as an 'out-of-touch echo chamber,' Bartels said.

'New Yorkers consider themselves to be more in tune with the reality of life in US urban centers and believe this helps them innovate products and services that are more closely aligned with the needs of the average American,' he said.

Not all tech companies are investing in areas outside of their original headquarters, however.

Microsoft is overhauling its headquarters in Redmond, Washington, with an 18-building construction project that will make room for an additional 8,000 workers.

It currently employs about 47,000 in the area.",235,Levi Sumagaysay,14-Dec-18,"Google Lauded, Amazon Slammed For Approach To Facial Recognition",559,The East Bay Times (california),,"Google Lauded, Amazon Slammed For Approach To Facial Recognition

HIGHLIGHT:еКGoogle said it would hold off on releasing facial recognition, while Amazon patent and possible work with ICE raise concerns.

This week in facial recognition news, contrasting approaches by two tech giants.

Thursday, Google said it would hold off on releasing facial recognition technology as part of its commitment to the responsible use of artificial intelligence.

Unlike some other companies, Google Cloud has chosen not to offer general-purpose facial recognition APIs before working through important technology and policy questions, said Kent Walker, Googles senior vice president of global affairs, in a blog post about Googles AI efforts in Asia.

He might have been referring to Amazon, which this week made news for a couple of facial recognition developments. One is its apparent work withеКImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which neither party has confirmed. But the retail/tech giant  whose employees are trying to push not to sell its facial recognition technology, Rekognition, to the government  wont say it doesnt.

We provide our Rekognition service to a variety of government agencies, and we think that the federal government should have access to the best available technology, Brian Huseman, Amazons vice president for public policy, told the New York City Council this week when a councilman asked whether Amazon has a relationship with ICE. And when BuzzFeed News followed up by asking the same question, it also got a non-denial.

Also, a patent application filed last month by Amazon seeks to marry Ring doorbell technology, which is now owned by Amazon, with Amazons facial recognition. Among other things, the patent mentions that users could add faces to a list of suspicious people and send it directly to law enforcement. CNN was the first to report on the patent.

Amazon is dreaming of a dangerous future, with its technology at the center of a massive decentralized surveillance network, running real-time facial recognition on members of the public using cameras installed in people's doorbells, said Jacob Snow, technology and civil liberties attorney at the ACLU of Northern California, in a blog post this week.

Earlier this year, the ACLU released results of its test of Rekognition: Amazons technology falsely matched the faces of 28 members of Congress with mugshots of people who have been arrested. The advocacy group and others are calling for a moratorium on government use of facial recognition.

Snow also warned that Amazon might extend surveillance capabilities to its popular Echo products, and share information with the government.

On the other hand, the ACLU praised Googles moral compass, referring to the companys decision to hold off on releasing its facial recognition technology.

When housing startup Starcity in October announced a plan to build its largest-ever co-living development in San Jose's urban core, the proposal, riddled with unanswered questions, was met with equal parts excitement and skepticism.

But this week, the developer and city answered some of those unknowns. San Francisco-based Starcity has submitted documents to San Jose planners that shed new light on its 18-story, 800-unit mixed-use proposal in the city's urban core. Meanwhile, city officials say they are making moves to potentially adjust San Jose's zoning code to allow such a development.

Starcity is a venture-backed startup that was valued at $50 million in a funding round earlier this year, emerged as a part of Y Combinator's Summer Batch two years ago and has developed a brand in the Bay Area for making ""dorm living for adults.""

Downtown San Jose's recent frenzy of business and developer interest drove the company to propose its first South Bay project, Starcity CEO Jon Dishotsky told the Business Journal in an interview shortly after announcing the project.

""There's starting to be a pretty big boom [in San Jose] and we want to make sure that's not just high-end condos and expensive hotels,"" he said. ""We really saw it as an opportunity to put a flag in the ground and really be intentional about it.""

Though the advances this week bode well for the developer's potential project - which could rise about a mile from where Alphabet Inc.-owned Google is aiming to build a massive new tech campus in San Jose - it's fair to say that any that initial skepticism wasn't necessarily unjust.

For starters, Starcity still doesn't own the land at 199 Bassett St., where it aims to build the project, though Dishotsky told the Business Journal this year they're working on a deal with property owner KT Urban.

The project, called Bassett, also faced a not-insignificant zoning hurdle: The residential projects with shared spaces, flexible leases and trendy services that Starcity has built its reputation on in San Francisco don't fit within any box in the San Jose zoning code - yet. The city is set to start gathering community feedback Jan. 9 about adding co-living to its downtown zoning guidelines.

""The market is showing in other cities, like San Francisco and places where Starcity has converted existing buildings into co-living arrangements, that it's popular,"" city spokesperson Cheryl Wessling said in an interview this week.

(Take a look through photos of other Starcity locations in California below)

Plans submitted to the city this week show Starcity hopes to build a mixed-use tower with 800 units, each with a private bedroom and bathroom, but shared kitchen and community space on the 0.77-acre site. The ground level would be home to a ""compact urban market"" spanning nearly 2,800 square feet above 186 underground parking spots. The project is being designed by Portland-based C2K Architecture.

KT Urban, for its part, already locked in approvals to build an 18-story tower on the site, which the Cupertino-based developer dubbed Aviato. But those plans included 302 traditional residential units on top of 10,000 square feet of retail.

Dishotsky said Starcity would wait to break ground until the project is re-entitled for his co-living vision, adding that he's approached San Jose officials as ""an open book,"" and is open to adjusting plans fit with the approved zoning.

""Overall, I think we're all after the same thing, which is to say that we're well below our affordable housing goals,"" he said. ""So, how can we create more comfortable housing at a lower price in the places that people want to be?""

HIGHLIGHT:еКGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai, head of one of the world's leading artificial intelligence companies, said in an interview this week that concerns about harmful applications of the technology are ""very legitimate"" - but the tech industry should be trusted to responsibly regulate its use.

By Tony Romm,Drew Harwell and Craig Timberg | The Washington Post

Google CEO Sundar Pichai, head of one of the worlds leading artificial intelligence companies, said in an interview this week that concerns about harmful applications of the technology are very legitimate - but the tech industry should be trusted to responsibly regulate its use.

Speaking with The Washington Post on Tuesday afternoon, Pichai said that new AI tools - the backbone of innovations such as driverless cars and disease-detecting algorithms - require companies to set ethical guardrails and think through how the technology can be abused.

I think tech has to realize it just cant build it, and then fix it, Pichai said. I think that doesnt work.

Tech giants have to ensure that artificial intelligence with agency of its own doesnt harm humankind, Pichai said. He said he is optimistic about the technologys long-term benefits, but his assessment of the potential risks of AI parallels that of some tech critics who say the technology could be used to empower invasive surveillance, deadly weaponry and the spread of misinformation. Other tech executives, like SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, have offered more dire predictions that AI could prove to be far more dangerous than nukes.

Googles AI technology underpins a range of initiatives, from the companys controversial China project to the surfacing of hateful conspiratorial videos on its YouTube subsidiary - a problem he vowed to address in the coming year. How Google decides to deploy its AI has also sparked recent employee unrest.

Pichais call for self-regulation followed his testimony in Congress, where lawmakers threatened to impose limits on technology in response to its misuse, including as a conduit for spreading misinformation and hate speech. His acknowledgement about the potential threats posed by AI was a critical assertion because the Indian-born engineer often has touted the world-shaping implications of automated systems that could learn and make decisions without human control.

Pichai said in the interview that lawmakers around the world are still trying to grasp AIs effects and the potential need for government regulation. Sometimes I worry people underestimate the scale of change thats possible in the mid-to-long term, and I think the questions are actually pretty complex, he said. Other tech giants, including Microsoft, recently have embraced regulation of AI - both by the companies that create the technology and the governments that oversee its use.

But AI, if handled properly, could have tremendous benefits, Pichai explained, including helping doctors detect eye disease and other ailments through automated scans of health data. Regulating a technology in its early days is hard, but I do think companies should self-regulate, he said. This is why weve tried hard to articulate a set of AI principles. We may not have gotten everything right, but we thought it was important to start a conversation.

Pichai, who joined Google in 2004 and became chief executive 11 years later, in January called AI one of the most important things that humanity is working on. He said it could prove to be more profound for human society than electricity or fire. But the race to perfect machines that can operate on their own has rekindled familiar fears that Silicon Valleys corporate ethos - move fast and break things, as Facebook once put it - could result in powerful, imperfect technology eliminating jobs and harming average people.

Within Google, its AI efforts also have created controversy: The company faced heavy criticism earlier this year due to its work on a Defense Department contract involving AI that could automatically tag cars, buildings and other objects for use in military drones. Some employees resigned due to what they called Googles profiting off the business of war.

Asked about the employee backlash, Pichai told The Post that his workers were an important part of our culture. They definitely have an input, and its an important input; its something I cherish, he said.

In June, after announcing that Google wouldnt renew the contract next year, Pichai unveiled a set of AI-ethics principles that included general bans on developing systems that could be used to cause harm, damage human rights or aid in surveillance violating internationally accepted norms.

The company faced earlier criticism for releasing AI tools that could be misused in the wrong hands. Googles release in 2015 of its internal machine-learning software, TensorFlow, has helped accelerate the wide-scale development of AI, but it has also been used to automate the creation of lifelike fake videos that have been used for harassment and disinformation.

Google and Pichai have defended the release by saying that keeping the technology restricted could lead to less public oversight and prevent developers and researchers from progressing its capabilities in beneficial ways.

Over time, as you make progress, I think its important to have conversations around ethics (and) bias, and make simultaneous progress, Pichai said during his interview with The Post.

In some sense, you do want to develop ethical frameworks, engage noncomputer scientists in the field early on, he said. You have to involve humanity in a more representative way, because the technology is going to affect humanity.

Pichai likened the early work to set parameters around AI to the academic communitys efforts in the early days of genetics research. Many biologists started drawing lines on where the technology should go, he said. Theres been a lot of self-regulation by the academic community, which I think has been extraordinarily important.

The Google executive said it would be most essential around the development of autonomous weapons, an issue thats rankled tech executives and employees. In July, thousands of tech workers representing companies including Google signed a pledge against developing AI tools that could be programmed to kill.

Pichai also said he found some hateful, conspiratorial YouTube videos described in a Washington Post story on Tuesday abhorrent, and he indicated that the company would work to improve its systems for detecting problematic content. The videos, which had been watched millions of times on YouTube since appearing in April, discussed baseless allegations that Democrat Hillary Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin had attacked, killed and drank the blood of a girl.

Pichai said he had not seen the videos, which he was questioned about during the congressional hearing, and he declined to say whether YouTubes shortcomings in this area were a result of limits in the detection systems or in policies for evaluating whether a particular video should be removed. But he added, Youll see us in 2019 continue to do more here.

Pichai also portrayed Googles efforts to develop a new product for the government-controlled Chinese internet market as preliminary, declining to say what the product might be or when it would come to market - if ever.

Dubbed Project Dragonfly, the effort has caused backlash among employees and human-rights activists who warn about the possibility of Google assisting government surveillance in a country that tolerates little political dissent. When asked whether its possible that Google might make a product that allows Chinese officials to know who searches for sensitive terms, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre, Pichai said it was too soon to make any such judgments.

Its a hypothetical, Pichai said. We are so far away from being in that position.",239,Jack Nicas And Karen Weise,13-Dec-18,Chase For Talent Pushes Tech Giants Far Beyond West Coast,1427,The New York Times,Technology,"Chase For Talent Pushes Tech Giants Far Beyond West Coast

HIGHLIGHT:еКAmazon and Google are aggressively opening offices outside of their Silicon Valley and Seattle hometowns. On Thursday, Apple said it would invest $1 billion in Austin, Tex.

SAN FRANCISCO -- This generation's biggest technology companies -- including Apple, Amazon and Google -- have long been tied to their hometowns. Now these giants are increasingly outgrowing their West Coast roots.

Driven by a limited pool of skilled workers and the ballooning cost of living in their home bases of Silicon Valley and Seattle, as well as President Trump's shifting immigration policies, the companies are aggressively taking their talent hunt across the United States and elsewhere. And they are coalescing particularly around a handful of urban areas that are already winners in the new knowledge-based economy, including New York City, Washington, Boston and Austin, Tex.

This eastward expansion accelerated on Thursday when Apple said it would build a $1 billion campus in Austin, expanding its presence there to over 11,000 workers and becoming the area's largest private employer. The decision followed Amazon's highly publicized selection of Queens and Arlington, Va., last month for new offices that would house at least 50,000 employees. Google, too, is shopping for more real estate in New York that could enable it to more than double its work force of 7,000 in the city.

""They're expanding out,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""Tech talent is in very short supply. So if these tech companies want to grow and flourish, they need to find talent in other parts of the country.""

The chase for tech talent has been global for decades, and Silicon Valley's older companies have had big offices all over the world for years. Intel, for example, has far more employees in Oregon than it does in California. Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies three years ago, has had large outposts in Idaho and Oregon.

Amazon, Apple and Google are now increasingly adopting the same strategy as they hire for growth and pursue the brightest minds in new technologies, in an effort to outmuscle one another. Over the past two years, Amazon's work force has doubled to 613,300 employees; Google's parent, Alphabet, has increased its head count by 35 percent, to 94,300; and Apple has grown nearly 14 percent, to 132,000 workers.

Many of the companies are trying to cozy up to top engineering schools in cities like Pittsburgh, where Google recently opened an office and where Uber has had a center, or Zurich as they search for hard-to-find talent in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. Cambridge, England, now hosts several A.I. research outposts for American tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft and Apple.

Like Cambridge, England, some cities in the United States have also become known for a particular area of tech expertise, in what has become a modern remake of the country's industrial era, when cities came to specialize in the production of cars, steel and coal.

The Seattle area, home to Amazon and Microsoft, is known for experts in cloud-computing services thanks to Amazon's leadership in that field. Pittsburgh is known for A.I. because of Carnegie Mellon University's computer science program. Cambridge, Mass., is associated with robotics, thanks to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And New York is often where cutting-edge work on financial services technology is done.

The search for talent outside Silicon Valley and Seattle has also been prompted by issues in the companies' hometowns, which have not built enough housing to keep up with their growing work forces. San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland and Seattle are the four most expensive major cities in the country based on home values, according to data from Zillow. The median home in San Francisco is valued at almost $1.4 million and more than $733,000 in Seattle. Questions also abound over the quality and funding of the areas' public school systems.

""Every day as a C.E.O., you have employees coming to you saying, 'I don't make enough to buy a house for my family,' and you already feel like you are paying through the nose,"" said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, the real estate site based in Seattle. ""Almost everyone is looking at other affordable places where you can open an office.""

Some economists said the Trump administration's tougher immigration policies could also restrict the tech giants from importing skilled workers from abroad to their West Coast headquarters. The Trump administration has increased the red tape in applying for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers and has denied petitions more often. Over a five-day window this April, employers submitted petitions for more than 190,000 specialized work visas, but only 85,000 can be granted annually.

That has helped push some tech companies into building major outposts in Canada, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver. Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economics professor, said that even if H-1B workers were to come through in abundance, it would still make sense to put them in cheaper cities, like Austin. He said, ""$100,000 goes a lot further in Austin than in Silicon Valley.""

Yet even as the tech companies move beyond the West Coast, their choices to converge on cities or towns that are already highly educated, wealthy and well employed do not spread the wealth.

More than 44 percent of all digital-service jobs in the United States were located in just 10 metro areas last year, including Seattle, San Francisco and San Jose, as well as New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Boston, according to research by Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. From 2015 to 2017, only nine metro areas increased their share of the nation's tech work force, including the West Coast tech hubs, as well as Austin and Denver.

""The tech industry concentrates in very few markets,"" said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. ""Our biggest concern is how do we make sure more cities, particularly midsized cities in the middle of the country, can be players in the tech economy?""

Amazon, which has about 45,000 people at its Seattle headquarters, has also opened 16 tech hubs in the United States. About 85 percent of those satellite employees are in six booming, highly educated urban areas -- the Bay Area, Washington region, New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Austin. Each has at least 1,000 workers.

(The bulk of Amazon's North American work force is made up of the more than 250,000 people who are dispersed in the company's roughly 110 warehouses around Canada and the United States and who make less money than their white-collar colleagues.)

Apple, which has been criticized by President Trump for not creating more domestic jobs, said on Thursday that its plans for Austin included a new 133-acre campus that will initially have 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations and other functions. It will ultimately be able to accommodate up to 15,000 workers.

Apple already has about 6,000 workers in Austin. The company said it applied for a $25 million grant from Texas, payable over 15 years, as well as property-tax rebates from Williamson County.

A person familiar with Apple's decision to expand outside Cupertino, Calif., where it just opened a new $5 billion headquarters, said the move into Austin was partly driven by the extreme housing prices in the Bay Area, as well as its aim to find more talent and add more diversity and military veterans to its work force.

The company added that it also planned to open 1,000-worker operations in Seattle, San Diego, and Culver City, Calif., and to add hundreds of employees in Pittsburgh, Boston, New York and Boulder, Colo., over the next three years.

Some economists said what was most remarkable was that it took the tech giants this long to aggressively expand beyond the West Coast.

""In a sense, what we're seeing is tech becoming a normal industry,"" Mr. Glaeser said, ""an industry that's not located in one incredibly expensive place.""

Google has paid $70 million to buy 4.6 acres in south Palo Alto that‰ЫЄs home to Space Systems Loral, a Google spokeswoman confirmed yesterday.

The spokeswoman didn‰ЫЄt want to elaborate on Google‰ЫЄs plans for the property at 3850 Fabian Way, not far from the Oshman Family JCC.

Over the past few years, Google has been steadily buying up properties in Palo Alto near its latest acquisition. In 2016 Google bought the former headquarters of Essex Property Trust at 935 East Meadow Circle for $18 million.

In 2013, Google bought a group of buildings on the 1000 block of East Meadow Circle for $60 million. This purchase comes shortly after Google paid $1 billion for a 12-building office park in Mountain View.

HIGHLIGHT:еКGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai's appearance before a Congressional panel was full of soundbite-worthy questions and answers, some of them cringe-worthy.

Google CEO Sundar Pichais testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday centered on Republican lawmakers accusations of bias against the tech giant.

But in a hearing full of soundbite-worthy questions and answers, Democratic lawmakers also got their point across in memorable ways.

For example, some Republican lawmakers complained about negative news articles about them coming up in Google search results.

Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Los Angeles, did a real-time search on Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa.

First article that pops up is from ABC News, Lieu said. It says Steve Kings racist immigration talk prompts calls for congressional censure. You dont have a group of people at Google sitting there thinking and trying to modify search results. Thats not whats happening, right? Pichai said no.

If you want positive search results, do positive things, Lieu said. If you dont want negative search results, dont do negative things If youre getting bad press articles and bad search results, dont blame Google or Facebook or Twitter - consider blaming yourself.

Speaking of King, his exchange with Googles chief executive  during which he also asked for names of the companys employees who work on Googles search algorithms so lawmakers can check their social media accounts for biases produced an obvious oops moment.

I have a 7-year-old granddaughter who picked up her phone during the election, and she's playing a little game, the kind of game a kid would play, King said, addressing the Google CEO. And up on there pops a picture of her grandfather I'd ask you: How does that show up on a 7-year-old's iPhone, who's playing a kid's game?

Congressman, the iPhone is made by a different company, Pichai answered.

Rep. Ro Khanna,еКa Democrat who represents California's 17th Congressional District, which includes parts of Silicon Valley, said in an interview with this publication before Pichais testimony that some of these Republicans should go and learn math. Maybe they need to take a class to learn what an algorithm is.

Dont show your tech illiteracy, he added. Its embarrassing.

Pichai was the fourth top executive of a tech giant to field questions about conservatives complaints that tech companies are biased against them. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey have all appeared before Congress this year to answer questions about bias, misinformation, data privacy and other issues.

Are these hearings doing any good?

People really need to understand the privacy implications about things like location privacy, or intellectual privacy  when people feel their searches are being analyzed or collected, saidеКIrina Raicu, director of the Internet Ethics program at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, on Wednesday. But she said thats not what the public is getting from the overly partisan hearings, which she says include lawmakers citing studies or reports about bias that have been debunked.

The hearings themselves become a sort of misinformation, Raicu said.

Its no surprise tech industry groups are declaring that Pichai withstood the Congressional grilling.

Google came away unscathed, Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation told the Washington Post.

On the issue of political bias, conservatives are neglecting to look to their principles before asking questions, tweeted Carl Szabo, vice president of NetChoice. Google best knows how to run their search engine in a way that benefits their consumers. Congress does not.

Meanwhile, lawmakers also asked Pichai about data privacy and his companys work on Project Dragonfly, which would revive Googles search engine in China. Pichai said Google supports federal privacy legislation, and that although employees are working on Project Dragonfly  which is raising concerns about Google yielding to Chinas censorship and other policies  the company does not have plans to launch search in China anytime soon.",242,Marisa Kendall,11-Dec-18,Homelessness In The Bay Area - It's Worse Than We Thought,662,The East Bay Times (california),,"Homelessness In The Bay Area - It's Worse Than We Thought

HIGHLIGHT:еКNew research takes issue with the number reported by the HUD-mandated ""Point-in-Time"" homeless counts -- a visual count every two years.

CLICK HERE if you are having trouble viewing the photos on your mobile device.

The massive tent encampments and dilapidated RVs lining neighborhood streets make it clear theres a problem, but according to a new report, the Bay Areas homelessness crisis is even worse than previously thought.

An estimated 25,951 people were living without homes in the Bay Area last year, researchers with housing and real estate website Zillow calculated in a report released Tuesday. Thats over 6,000 more than were officially counted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Zillow analysts built algorithms that took into account cities populations, poverty rates, rent affordability and other metrics, and calculated by how much the official counts were likely to be off. The company hopes the new numbers can give struggling cities a more realistic picture of homelessness in their communities, and help them come up with better solutions.

To really get the scope of this problem, having more accurate numbers is important  to really justify that this is an issue that deserves attention, said Skylar Olsen, director of economic research and outreach for Zillow.

Homelessness experts have long agreed that the HUD-mandated Point-in-Time homeless counts  which rely on volunteers and city and county staff performing a visual count of homeless residents every two years  undercount communities homeless residents.

Just think about the sheer logistical challenge of counting a population which is transitory, possibly moving around, and could have every incentive to hide themselves, Olsen said.

Zillow estimates there were 10,121 homeless residents living in Santa Clara County last year  up from the 7,394 counted by the HUD census. In Alameda County, Zillow estimated there were 6,975 homeless  compared to 5,629 counted by HUD. And in San Francisco, Zillow estimated a homeless population of 8,855  up from the 6,858 counted by HUD.

Its no secret that people doing work in these communities know that the point-in-time count has been a continuous undercount  the methodology is reflective of one night in a year, not the ongoing need, said Jennifer Loving, CEO of Santa Clara County nonprofit Destination: Home. I think the real question is: when will the Bay Area realize that we have an extraordinary crisis for folks who need  extremely low-income housing, and when will we collectively respond?

In September alone, 333 new households came to Destination: Home seeking help finding shelter or paying rent, but housing was available for just 132 of them. That means 201 families fell through the cracks in just one month  possibly adding to the regions homeless population, Loving said. She urged the Bay Area to invest more money in homelessness prevention, and to prioritize building low-income housing.

As rents continue to rise in the Bay Area, the regions homelessness crisis will get worse,еКOlsen said.еКIn the San Francisco area, where the median rent is $4,331, a 2 percent increase could make 67 more people homeless, while a 5 percent increase could cost 173 more people their homes, according to the Zillow report. In the San Jose area, where the median rent is $3,542, a 2 percent increase in median rents could push 59 more people into homelessness, and a 5 percent increase could lead to 147 more people becoming homeless.

Its a national problem, Olsen said. Zillow estimated there were 661,000 homeless residents living in the U.S. last year. That means HUD reports undercounted the homeless population by more than 100,000 people.",243,The Associated Press,11-Dec-18,Another Privacy Lapse Speeds Closure Of Google Plus,593,The East Bay Times (california),,"Another Privacy Lapse Speeds Closure Of Google Plus

HIGHLIGHT:еКGoogle is still having trouble protecting the personal information on its Plus service, prodding the company to accelerate its plans to shut down the little-used social network created to compete against Facebook.

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE | The Associated Press

SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - Google is still having trouble protecting the personal information on its Plus service, prodding the company to accelerate its plans to shut down the little-used social network created to compete against Facebook.

A privacy flaw that inadvertently exposed the names, email addresses, ages and other personal information of 52.5 million Google Plus users last month convinced Google to close the service in April instead of August, as previously announced. Google revealed the new closure date and its latest privacy lapse in a Monday blog post .

Its the second time in two months that Google has disclosed the existence of a problem that enabled unauthorized access to Plus profiles. In October, the company acknowledged finding a privacy flaw affecting 500,000 Plus users that it waited more than six months to disclose.

Google moved more quickly to own up to the most recent privacy problem on Plus. This time around, the names, email addresses, ages and other personal information of the affected Plus users were exposed for six days in November before it was fixed. No financial information or passwords were visible to intruders, according to Google. The company also said it hasnt seen evidence indicating that unauthorized users who accessed Plus through the inadvertent peephole have missed used any of the personal information.

Even if the latest privacy gaffe on Plus didnt cause any major damage, it nevertheless marks another embarrassing incident for Google. The companys business model relies on it being seen as a trustworthy guardian of the personal information it collects about the billions of people who use its search engine, Gmail, Chrome browser, maps, and Android software for smartphones.

Like Facebook, Google makes most of its money by selling ads that draw upon what the company learns about the interests, habits and locations of people while theyre using its free services.

Googles privacy issues on Plus are likely to be a topic that U.S. lawmakers delve into Tuesday, when company CEO Sundar Pichai is scheduled to appear before a House committee. Pichais appearance comes more than three months after he turned down an invitation to testify in August, to the consternation of some lawmakers. Some members of Congress are now mulling whether tougher regulations to curb the power of Google, Facebook and other technology companies are needed in addition demanding tighter controls over digital privacy.

Facebook has had even more trouble guarding the personal information that it scoops up on its social networking service, which now has more than 2.2 billion users. The most glaring breakdown emerged in March when Facebook acknowledged the personal information of as many as 87 million of its users had been shared with Cambridge Analytica, a data mining firm affiliated with President Donald Trumps 2016 campaign.

The desire to peer into peoples lives is one of the reasons that Google launched Plus in 2011. It was supposed to be a challenger to Facebooks social network, but Plus turned into a digital ghost town that Google began to de-emphasize several years ago.

Months after Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg went before Congress to testify about his companys data-privacy practices, Google CEO Pichai faced questioning Tuesday by members of the House Judiciary Committee about political bias, data collection, privacy and the possibility that the online giant would launch a new, censored version of its internet search engine in China. Pichai was the only person who testified during the session, titled Transparency & Accountability: Examining Google and its Data Collection, Use and Filtering Practices.

Among the topics committee members grilled Pichai about areеКpolitical bias in Google search results.еКThe company has come under fire from President Donald Trump and some Republican legislators, who assert that the tech giant gives preference to liberal groups and organizations as well as promotes anti-conservative positions in some of its search results.

Pichai answered some lawmakers questions about its search results by asserting that the company doesnt engage in favoritism with the information it delivers. He said Google provides users with the best experience and the most relevant information.

Pichai also said that Google continues to work being more transparent when it comes to the methods it uses to collect data from its users, and that it is taking steps to make it easier for individuals to control their personal informationеК- and to remove such data from their privacy settings.

Its an ongoing area of effort, Pichai said of Googles efforts to improve the privacy of individuals data.

Prior to Pichais Congressional appearance, Google had come under fire for working on the controversial Dragonfly search engine, a project to create a censored Internet search engine for use in China. There have been concerns that anything Google does in China could be used by the Chinese government to spy on its citizens via their internet use.

Pichai said that, at times, more than 100 Google engineers have worked on Dragonfly, but he tried to downplay some of the concerns about the project by saying that right now, there are no plans to launch a search service in China.

HIGHLIGHT:еКGoogle's latest acquisition, a $70 million cash deal to buy a big Palo building, is a fresh indicator that the search giant's quest for expansion room is far from over.

PALO ALTO - Google has gobbled up a huge building that had been owned by SSL, a maker of satellites and space systems that once was known as Space Systems Loral, a fresh acquisition that hints the search giant's quest for expansion room is far from over.

The search giant paid $70 million on Dec. 6 for a long narrow building and an adjacent surface parking lot that sit on 4.6 acres at 3850 Fabian Way at the corner of East Meadow Drive in Palo Alto, according to Santa Clara County property records.

Mountain View-based Google, through spokeswoman Katherine Williams, confirmed the all-cash purchase, but stated the tech titan wouldn't discuss the situation in any detail.

The 101,000-square-foot building, originally constructed in 1991, is located in an area where Google has been purchasing and occupying an array of smaller buildings.

And just a few miles away, in Mountain View, Google last month paid a head-spinning $1 billion for a 12-building, 51.8-acre parcel that is the Bay Area's biggest property transaction this year and the nation's second largest.

HIGHLIGHT:еКGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai answered a broad range of questions in front of the House Judiciary Committee, including questions about the company's plans for China, concerns over political bias and its data collection practices.

[id=3]

On Tuesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai endured nearly three and a half hours of questioning in front of the House Judiciary Committee about the company he leads, including its market position, complaints of political bias, and concerns over it launching a censored search product in China.

Although other tech CEOs have struggled under the pressure of Congressional questioning, Pichai remained relatively cool throughout and stuck to more repetitive answers to lines of questioning that came from both parties.

Three big issues that came up during the hearing were allegations that Google search results are biased against conservative viewpoints and news sources; concerns over how Android devices collect data; and pointed questions about whether Google was planning a censored search product for China. Other issues that arose included concerns over Google's market dominance, forced arbitration of employee claims, and how content is filtered on Google's platform.

""The technology behind online services like social media and Internet search engines can also be used to suppress particular viewpoints and manipulate public opinion,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) said in a statement before the hearing. ""Americans put their trust in big tech companies to honor freedom of speech and champion open dialogue, and it is Congress' responsibility to the American people to make sure these tech giants are transparent and accountable in their practices.""

Allegations that Google's search results are biased against conservatives was the theme of a number of questioners - indeed, Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-TX) spent his five minutes making allegations without actually asking any questions of Pichai at all. Democrats mostly dismissed these allegations, though Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) complained that when he searched his own name previously, the results tended to be from conservative news organizations.

In response to these allegations, Pichai mostly stuck to variations on the line that was included in his written testimony, ""I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way."" He re-iterated that Google's search results can't be manipulated by one person and that it's designed to be robust and responsive to user feedback.

A number of members of both parties had a lot of pointed questions about the way that Android devices and Google products collect data. For example, Chairman Goodlatte's opening statement noted that Android products collect a lot of data and that while many consumers may consent to this data collection via terms of service, most of them ""have no idea"" what's being collected.

On numerous occasions during this line of questioning, Pichai stated that Google was working to make it easier for consumers to understand its privacy policies. That includes simplifying its privacy dashboards and sending reminders to users to check up on their privacy settings. Still, he admitted that the company still as a lot of work to do in that area.

The other line of questioning that both parties agreed on involved expressing concern over Google's Project Dragonfly, which Pichai described to the Committee as an exploratory project to see how a search product might operate in China. Pichai admitted that over 100 employees had worked on the project over the course of a number of months, but denied that Google had any plans to expand a search product to China.

That said, the prospect of a potential Chinese expansion did seem to be on his mind. On several occasions, Pichai noted part of Google's mission is to ""explore possibilities to give users access to information,"" but he tried to ensure lawmakers that the company would engage with U.S. policymakers before taking any steps to move into China.

A number of references were made also during the hearing to Google's market dominance in search, including wielding of a number claiming that 90% of searchers are made on Google's platform. These stats from eMarketer highlight how Google compares to its search rivals.

[id=2]

Pichai seemed to bristle at this particular claim, stating that the stat doesn't adequately reflect how people search. He noted, for example, that studies of searches for products to shop for don't include Amazon, which he said was many consumers' go-to first stop for shopping.

Live Updates:

1:37pm - It's been about 3 and a half hours and the hearing is now over. The members of the committee will have 5 days to submit more questions for Pichai to respond to in writing later. Google's stock at the end of this ordeal? 1057.87 - about 6.73 lower than when it started. But still higher than yesterday's close.

1:33 pm - Rep. Martha Roby (R-AL) asks about what Google is doing to educate its users about a privacy policy that she says is ""20 pages long"" and ""changes multiple times per year."" Pichai said that it's working to make its dashboards clearer and also make it possible to reduce the number of controls. ""We're trying to match with user expectations"" - for example, if users search for a restaurant, they want local restaurants. Pichai says that he agrees there's more work to be done and that it still needs to be more simplified.

1:26 pm - Rep. John Rutherford (R-FL) asks about Google's privacy policies, and whether they apply when they are tracked with cookies by ads. Pichai says that Google Ad Services are covered by its privacy policies. He also asked about whether Google Voice records conversations. Pichai says that when Voice is triggered, it's treated like a search query and that users have the choice as to whether that data is stored.

1:21 pm - Rep. Steve King (R-IA) asks about the employment process for Google's search team. Pichai noted that there's over 1,000 people on the search team. King complained that the names of these engineers are unknown to the public and he asked if Google looked into their public social media. Pichai said that the company supports free expression and doesn't investigate the private lives of its employees, and notes that the page ranking algorithms are prioritized by users, not the engineers.

1:15 pm - Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) complains about Google's selection of legal advocacy non-profit Southern Poverty Law Center as a ""trusted flagger"" of its content and accuses Pichai of being surrounded by ""liberality"" that ""hates conservatives."" He then complained about Google featuring Wikipedia in its search results. Gohmert suggests that when such content partners are subject to any legal liability, Google should be held liable as well. Gohmert asked no questions and so Pichai provided no response.

1:09 pm - Rep. Val Demings (D-FL) asked specifically about Google's policies with respect to predatory ads. Pichai said that Google has strict policies for consumer protection against predatory ads but admits it's an area where the company is trying to do better.

1:04 pm - Rothfus asked Pichai more about China, particularly in the context of what Rothfus describes as ""drifting authoritarianism"" in China. He asked if Google designed a prototype for a search engine that could be used in China. Pichai admitted there was an exploratory project to demonsrate what a search engine would look like if it was deployed in a country like China, and admitted that over 100 people were involved in such a project.

1:02 pm- Rep. Keith Rothfus (R-PA) asks how Google ensures ideological diversity among its employees and staff. Pichai says that Google does promote different viewpoints among its staff.

12:56 pm- Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) asks about the issue of forced arbitration in resolving claims with corporations, a practice that Google ended when it came to issues of sexual harassment. She asked if Pichai would commit to ending forced arbitration agreements for other cases involving civil rights. Pichai said that it's an issue that Google is looking further into.

12:52pm - Handel also asked about Google's work in providing election information. Pichai said there were no direct efforts, but that for example the Google home page provided links to polling locations and times.

12:49 pm- Rep. Karen Handel (R-GA) asks if paid users of Google Suite products have different privacy policies compared to free products like Gmail. Pichai stated that privacy protections are the same for all users.

12:46 pm - Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) asks about a Washington Post article published today of discredited conspiracy theories spreading on YouTube. Pichai said that the company is working to better monitor such content.

12:41 pm - Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) asks how Google can protect its results from foreign powers. Pichai says that there are a lot of robust systems that prevent one person from having significant impact on such results. Biggs goes on to more pointedly ask about Google's work with China, particularly with respect to data sharing with the Chinese government. Pichai says there is no sharing with China because it has no products with user data deployed in China and no agreements with the Chinese government on data. Biggs went on to ask about data sharing with the U.S. government, and Pichai said that Google is responsive to valid law enforcement requests.

12:36 pm - Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) began his questions by first criticizing about his colleagues' complaints about Google's political bias, which he says aren't in keeping in the spirit of the First Amendment, which protects the speech of companies like Google. He then showed off a poster showing search results for Rep. Steve Scalise (R-VA), and it showed the top results were positive and featured conservative news outlets. He then noted that the first search for Rep. Steve King (R-IA) was negative. But then asked Pichai - is there anyone specifically manipulating results? Pichai said no there isn't.

12:30 pm - Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA)asks about a Google project, Perspective, which uses machine learning to filter out unacceptable content. Johnson asks how Google can guarantee that tool won't filter out conservative content. Pichai responded by stating that Perspective is intended to be a tool for other publishers, and it's up to them to make decisions about filtering.

12:28 pm - Stock watch: GOOG is now at 1057.16, down from the start of the hearing but 4.52 higher than yesterday's close.

12:26 pm - Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) asks about Google's local searches about businesses, and whether those searches can take advantage of third-party information and not just Google reviews. Pichai says that Google utilizes a large number of sources, including its own data.

12:21 pm - Rep. Matthew Gaetz (R-FL) asks if Google has launched an investigation into political bias among its employees. Pichai outlines the steps necessary to change Google's search algorithms, which involve committees and user testing. Gaetz goes on to complain that there's a Google discussion group of people who oppose President Trump's political agenda. Pichai denies any knowledge of such a group, but stated that Google's systems are designed with protections to prevent against bad faith actors.

12:11 pm - Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) changes the topic to Google's impact on the competitive landscape, and asks whether Google will end what he calls discriminatory practices against competitors such as those found by the EU. Pichai said Google is appealing that EU finding and that it doesn't discriminate against competitors.

12:08 pm- Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) asked a series of questions about what kinds of data that Google collects - but also what Google doesn't collect. Pichai said that the company aims to minimize the amount of data it collects to what's necessary. Collins followed up by asking how many people know they can control what data Google collects. Pichai says that Google provides reminders about checking up on data collection settings.

11:59 am- Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA) asks what Google is doing to protect the integrity of its search results from manipulative bots and ""troll farms."" Pichai says that Google deals with bots on a number of issues like Spam, and that Google works with law enforcement and its own data to look for spikes in activity that make it clear they're not caused by humans.

11:55am - Marino asks what Google does to protect the security of its users from hackers. This is an issue that Pichai says, ""keeps me up at night"" and that Google works with law enforcement to have a comprehensive approach.

11:54am - Rep. Tom Marino (R-PA) returns the tenor of the conversation to Google in China. He asks if anything has changed since Google chose to leave China in 2010. Pichai re-iterated that Google has no plans to launch a search product in China, and says that if that changes, he'd be transparent with U.S. policymakers about it.

11:46 am - Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL) asks whether Google should be accountable for the content on its platforms. Pichai says that it has a responsibility to provide accurate information.

11:43am - Poe asks what Google considers objectionable in terms of extreme political views. Pichai responds with its hate speech policy, which Google defines as inciting hate or violence.

11:41 am - Rep. Ted Poe (R-TX) asks whether Google could tell his location in the room based on the data in his iPhone. Pichai says that it wouldn't be by default and that it would depend on its application settings. Poe brings up the EU's GDPR, which he has introduced legislation to introduce similar protections from into U.S. law.

11:37 am - Johnson moved on to more concerns about the protection of Google's user data and how users can trust the company with their information. Pichai says that software inevitably has bugs, but that Google invests a lot of resources into finding exploitable bugs to keep information and data secure. He also asks what Google does with geolocation data. Pichai says that Google never sells user data, and gives its users control over how their data is used to deliver ads to them.

11:34 am - Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA) followed up on Jordan's line of questioning about whether Google had paid for such efforts. Pichai categorically denied that it provides any partisan election features.

11:32 am- Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) discusses an email from a Google employee about pushing out the Latino vote ""in key states."" Pichai denied that Google had any involvement in partisan election efforts, and that Google had no involvement in partisan election efforts or pay for voters. He said that an internal investigation found no evidence for partisan organizations, and that Google provides information to voters about registration and polling locations. He said that Google did not provide any support to get out the vote for any segment of the population.

11:25 am - Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) complains about the like of phone support for Google customer help. He moves on to ask about the use of bots on YouTube by governments like Russia to downvote content from human rights activists. Pichai says that Google is committed to free expression, and that the company works to counter bots that behave in this manner. Steve Cohen then says he did a search for himself and found that the top results were primarily conservative news sites like The Daily Caller and Bretibart even though he appeared on MSNBC that weekend. Pichai again re-iterated that Google's search results work in a politically neutral manner.

11:20am - Stock watch: GOOG is now at 1054.16, down from the start of the hearing but up on yesterday's close.

11:19  am - Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) continues the line of questioning about political bias in search results, pointing to perceived results that bias exists among the search engine results. Pichai again replies that its algorithms don't include such bias. Issa moves on to ask whether Google's dashboards on Android phones can be improved to be more transparent about privacy. ""It's an area where we want to do better,"" agrees Pichai.

11:14 am - Jackson-Lee's next question is about how YouTube is promoting diversity among its employees. Pichai says the company does reach out to minority communities and wants to ensure they're represented. He highlights that Google was one of the first to publish its internal diversity numbers but that it's an issue they're committed to doing more.

11:12am - Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-TX) asks whether Google takes down hate speech directs violence, to which Pichai responds that it does. She then asks whether Google will protect privacy in email, to which Pichai says it does. She also asked whether Google is doing anything to halt to sale of unsafe or ineffective medicines. Pichai says that it's working with law enforcement on such efforts. She then asked about Google's plans in China, to which Pichai responded that Google has no plans to launch search in China.

11:07am - Rep. Steve Chabot (R-OH) has the floor, and begins with a line of argument of his own first-hand experience in having to go to a 3rd or 4th page of search results to find good things about Republican-proposed health care policy or the recently passed Republican tax cut bill. Pichai says that he understands the frustration in seeing negative news - which he sees when he searches for himself and Google. He states that the algorithm reflects what is being said objectively, which he says is without regard to political ideology. Chabot disagrees: ""You've got somebody out there"" changing search results. Pichai said that he's happy to follow up and explain more about how the process works. Chabot concludes just by thanking Google for its work in supporting small business.

11:01am - Lofgren asks a little about how search works, highlighting that it's not ""just a little man behind a curtain"" making decisions about search results. Pichai notes that the search engine is mostly driven algorithmically and done at scale.

10:59 am - Lofgren builds on Goodlatte's question and asks if she has an Android phone with no apps on it, what data is collected? Pichai says that by default, location is turned on, and that IP addresses also provide some location info.

10:58 am - Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) whose district includes San Jose, asks a ""parochial"" question about how an expansion of Google's headquarters will impact the local housing market. Pichai says that Google is working to minimize such an impact.

10:55 am - Smith asks Pichai whether Google would allow third-parties to investigate its search results for political bias. Pichai says that such third-party studies have happened, and that Google publishes its search guidelines. Smith asks whether any employee has been sanctioned for ""manipulating search results"" to which Pichai says it would be impossible for one employee to make such changes.

10:54 am - Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) opens his questions claiming that Google is using its platform to censor conservative views. He cites a claim from PJ Media that 96% of searches for Trump come from ""left-leaning sources"" as a sign that Google is not operating objectively. (Note: Politifact found that this PJ Media claim is false.) Pichai replied to this by claiming first of all that several citations that Smith cited were inaccurate and had problems with methodology. But he said he'd be happy to provide Google's findings to Smith's office. Pichai says that the top news sources on media reflect a diversity of sources.

10:50 am - Nadler's last question is about the spread of hate speech, particularly on YouTube. Pichai says that YouTube's content policies are clear and that they take actions accordingly when they're violated.

10:49 am - Nadler's next line of questioning is about the extent of how Russian agents have used Google to spread misinformation. Pichai said that Google's investigation uncovered to major ad accounts that were serving this, and that the company took steps to prevent Russia and other foreign powers are doing the same. It looks more into how ads are bought and where purchases are located, he said, and will work with law enforcement on identifying actions of those powers.

10:47 am - Jerry Nadler (D-CA) opens by asking what legal obligation Google has to reveal data exposures like the bug in Google Plus. Pichai responded by saying it was generally reported within 72 hours.

10:44am - Stock watch: The hearing doesn't seem to be hurting Google's stock right now, which is sitting at 1062.18

10:43 am - Goodlatte shifts gears to the question of filtering objectionable content. He notes that objectionable content can also be the most engaging, setting up a conflict of interest of revenue. Goodlatte asked Pichai whether Google wants to filter out objectionable material for a ""healthier civic dialogue."" Pichai replied by stating that filtering out objectionable content is healthier for Google and YouTube in the long run.

10:41 am - Goodlatte asks Pichai whether its true that Android phones send location and other data to Google ""every few minutes."" Pichai notes that what data is collected depends on what apps users choose to use. For example, he says, someone with a Fitbit app wants that data to be transferred. Pichai says that yes, the phones send data to Google but insists that it's transparent. Goodlatte was also interested in what Google's users know about what data is collected. Pichai responds to this by highlighting the company's Privacy Checkup, which prompts users about their privacy settings.

10:37 am - Sundar Pichai has been sworn in and gave a summary version of the written testimony that was released earlier. In it, he highlighted Google's America's roots and notes that Google has a presence in a number of states and noted that it has over 24,000 employees and brings over $150 billion into the U.S. economy. ""Protecting the privacy of our users"" is a priority for the company, he says. He also highlights his claim that there's no political bias in Google's products, and that the company's employees feature a wide diversity of opinion.

10:31 am - Ranking member Jerry Nadler (D-NY) gave his opening statement. Like Goodlatte, he notes the public reliance on Google and notes his questions about the collection of private data. However, he goes on to dismiss the idea that Google has an ""anti-conservative bias"" and claims that such ""fact-free propaganda"" engenders mistrust of tech companies. He adds, thought, that even if Google did discriminate against conservative viewpoints, that's its right as a private company, just like Fox News, and ""shouldn't be questioned by government."" But he does want to know how Google plans to stop ""hostile foreign powers"" from using Google's platform to spread disinformation. He's also interested in knowing how Google plans to deal with the spread of communication from groups that lead to rise in hate crimes and other bigoted action. He concludes with concerns about Google's market dominance and whether other companies can compete, about the spread of pirated material on Google, how Google protects private data in light of revealed bugs in Google Plus that could lead to misuse of data, and whether Google plans to build a censored search engine in China.

10:25 am - Goodlatte continued in his statement to know that studies have shown that search engine rankings can shift voting patterns of undecided voters, and raises questions about how the search engine might influence democracy. Additionally, in talking about privacy, he says that most people with Android phones likely have no idea how many sensors are collecting data at a given time. He goes on to note that Google is basically unavoidable, since its ads are served all over the internet and its search tool is often the default even on non-Google-owned sites and products. He closes his statement by citing Google as an example of ""the American dream"" founded by two people in a garage.

10:19 am - Judiciary chair Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) give his opening statement, highlighting the amount of data that Google collects from its search engine, Gmail, Android operating system and others. He notes that yes, consumers consent to this via Terms of Service agreements, but that they likely ""have no idea"" how much data is being collected. He also says that Google is often the ""first and last stop"" for people getting information on the internet, and says that the Committee wants to investigate how Google makes decisions about filtering content in search results. ""Americans deserve to know what information they're not getting"" when they use Google search, he says.

10:12 am - The hearing started a few minutes late with an introduction from Chairman Goodlatte and an opening statement from Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), who notes Google's dominance of the search engine market and claims that the American public increasingly distrusts technology companies. He goes further to set the stage for the hearing, with questions about whether political bias impacts Google search results, whether it promotes free-market ideals, and speaking concerns about reports that Google is preparing a censored search engine for China. He pointedly asks: ""Are America's technology companies serving as instruments of freedom, or instruments of control?""

9:55am - As we get ready for the hearings to begin, we'll be keeping an eye on Google's stock price, which right now is at 1,064.60 - up a little over a percent from yesterday's close. Stock prices have a tendency to be volatile during Congressional testimony. When Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, his company's stock dropped over 6%.",248,,11-Dec-18,Google Submits Massive Development Plan For Mountain View,347,Indian Technology News,,"Google Submits Massive Development Plan For Mountain View

New Delhi, Dec. 11 -- On Sunday Google revealed plans for the wide-scale development of its hometown of Mountain View, California. The search giant is looking to build offices, retail shops, public, and residential spaces on the property it owns around the area of its future campus. According to Mountain View city documents obtained by CNBC, the company has extensive real estate holdings centering around the North Bayshore area. Google is planning 3.12 million square feet of office space, both new and redeveloped. It is also looking at adding 400,000 sqft of retail zoned buildings and 35 acres of public space. It wants to construct up to 8,000 new homes. Google has already consulted with a developer to build 6,600 residences, 20 percent of which will qualify for affordable housing. The tech company is working closely with the Mountain View city council to ensure it complies with the ""Precise Plan"" development rules it instituted in 2017. ""Of course, this project is about much more than just office space; it's about doing more with the local community as well,"" said Google's Vice President of Real Estate David Radcliffe in a blog post. ""So we're adding lots of bike paths and retail opportunities, like restaurants, for local businesses. We also hope to bring new life to the unique local environment, from enhancing burrowing owl habitats to widening creek beds."" Approval of the plans has not yet been granted, but the city is set to start discussions early in the new year. Google does not foresee any problems getting the proposal approved. The city already gave the go-ahead to plans for a new campus in North Bayshore (illustration below) and construction has already begun on that project. CNBC estimates the company has spent nearly $2.8 billion buying up property in Mountain View and outlying areas including San Jose in the last couple of years. It has also been approved just this week to purchase another 10 acres in San Jose for $110 million. You can read Google's complete plan at the Mountain View city website, but as of this writing the site is down.",249,Jody Meacham,11-Dec-18,Public Has Great Expectations For San Jose's Diridon Station Amid Google Campus,620,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Public Has Great Expectations For San Jose's Diridon Station Amid Google Campus

In discussing his hopes for what will be the new Diridon Station in San Jose, Joint Venture Silicon Valley CEO Russell Hancock fretted about ending up ""with is something that isn't bold, visionary and exciting ... instead, we'll end up with some common-denominator solution that nobody really loves but nobody objected to either.""

If the couple of hundred people who showed up Monday night for the first community input meeting on the Diridon Integrated Station Concept Plan are reflective of city residents as a whole, Hancock should have no worries.

One commenter said he expected ""the most impressive train station in the world, the one people in other places will come to see to model theirs after.""

""This will be the only place in the Bay Area where you have so many transportation modes converging in the same place,"" said Eric Eidlin, the city transportation department's station planning manager. ""That's one of the main reasons why our city's policy framework seeks to concentrate a lot of the urban development that we're expecting right around the station.""

Planners, armed with the knowledge of mass transit dreams of Diridon's current and future passenger railroads, have been thinking about what it will become for some time. But most city residents hadn't paid much attention until summer 2017, when Google announced it wanted to capitalize on the station's potential by building millions of square feet of office space in the neighborhood.

Those plans hit a key milestone last week, when the city agreed to sell 10.5 acres of publicly owned land in the city core to the search giant for $110 million.

Many of Monday's speakers in small group discussions had aspirations of ""something inspiring, not a stingy space,"" ""decent restaurants, not just fast food,"" lots of public services like medical facilities or an onsite hotel, connections to the airport, Guadalupe River Park and nature, and that it not be an impermeable barrier between east and east.

They were even interested in what Eidlin said is one of the fundamental issues to be decided in the planning stages, which is the governance structure of the facility itself, or as a speaker put it, ""who will own this station and profit from it?""

Eidlin, who has studied similar rail stations in Europe and traveled with a local delegation last year to see several in the Netherlands, said that question is much easier to answer in countries with with well-funded national rail authorities that bring significant funding and expertise to the development of projects. Those agencies play a more significant role in developing and funding projects like that at Diridon.

Caltrain owns Diridon now, but Jim Ortbal, deputy city manager and previously head of the transportation department, said that will be among issues for discussions in the future.

At the same time as this series of public comment meetings about the future station continues every few months through 2019, the city, Caltrain, the Valley Transportation Authority and California high-speed rail are meeting with two Dutch architectural firms to hash out the engineering and technical questions regarding how they will connect with each other and operate within the relatively small footprint available.

One of the most important questions to answer there is how many tracks it will take to efficiently serve the number of trains Diridon is expected to host and on how many and what levels it will require given the land available.

City officials hope to craft a preferred plan for the station by next summer from future meetings.

HIGHLIGHT:еКVint Cerf -- father of the internet and Google executive -- says companies and governments alike should be held accountable by their employees and constituents.

Vint Cerf is the longtime chief internet evangelist for Google. But he is also one of the fathers of the internet - from work he couldn't have done without the help of the government.

So what does he think about Google employees protesting their company's work with the government?

""It's a call to morality,"" Cerf said in an interview with this publication Sunday night at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, where he was one of the speakers at a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Doug Engelbart's epic computing demo. ""That's a good thing.""

After Google workers protestedеКthe tech giant's project to provide the Pentagon with artificial intelligence technology for drone analysis over concerns it could be used for more precise drone strikes in war, the company said earlier this year it would not renew the contract. Google CEO Sundar Pichai also introduced a set of principles declaring that the company's AI would not be knowingly used for harm.

Now Google employees are speaking up against the company's purported work on search in China,еКwhich is expected to give the government there what it wants: a search engine it can censor.

Cerf's long, storied career includes stints at DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Department of Defense agency that funded the development of the internet), Stanford University, MCI, IBM and more. He also is former chairman ofеКthe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).

""I've worked for nonprofits, governments, companies,"" he said, adding that they all need to be held accountable.

Diridon Station sits in the center of San Jose. It's owned by one of the oldest commuter railroads in the United States and within a decade is set to receive two more railroads, BART and California's high-speed rail line, with dozens of new trains from each.

That level of connectivity is expected to generate 140,000 daily passenger visits - eight times as many as today - but that's been known for years.

It wasn't until June that those four parties - with the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority as BART's stand-in since it's building BART in Santa Clara County - agreed they should work together to design a facility that will bring as many people downtown as San Francisco International Airport deals with every day.

The public part of the process to figure out how such a place will function as a useful transit hub and an urban public space uniting a city - though not what it will look like - begins at 6 p.m. today at the Diridon Integrated Station Concept Plan Community Kick-Off Meeting at Westminster Presbyterian Church at the corner of The Alameda and Shasta Avenue.

Downtown Association head Scott Knies called the obvious but long-awaited four-party cooperation ""one of the most significant and under-the-radar achievements of the past year"" in his annual October speech.

With all the separate community groups working on what happens with BART, high-speed rail, Google's potential downtown campus development and a bunch of other projects envisioned for downtown San Jose, it's easy to get confused about what this series of four meetings over the next eight months is supposed to focus on.

But a lot of the heavy lifting will be done by ""ABC"" - the two Dutch firms, Arcadis and Benthem Crouwel - which have collaborated in the past on similar projects in Europe, including the Amsterdam Centraal Station, which was visited by a delegation of elected and transportation officials in July 2017.

A bit more than a year and $6.4 million from now, ABC is supposed to present a plan to achieve the sort of station most everyone in San Jose would like to see, but can't figure out how to make work.

Russell Hancock, president and CEO of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, compared the new station to the replacement of the Oakland end of the Bay Bridge, where the original conventional design eventually was supplanted by a landmark structure even though it cost more.

""I'm concerned that all of the naysayers and small thinkers will have their way because we have created a system where everyone has veto power,"" Hancock said. ""So what we (might) end up with is something that isn't bold, visionary and exciting and will put San Jose on the map. Instead, we'll end up with some common-denominator solution that nobody really loves but nobody objected to either.""

City transportation department spokesman Colin Heyne said this first meeting will be largely informational but there will be a Q&A session and small group discussions.

""We want to make it clear to people that this is not a rehashing of what's been going on for the last year with the station area advisory group,"" he said. ""This is specifically focused on the station itself. We really want to talk about how all those different trains and buses are going to fit into a station area. How we can get customers or riders from one service to another? How can we lay the station out so that that is smooth and efficient, and also how people, for instance, living in Cahill Park can traverse the station and get to downtown?""

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe free food that Google and many other tech companies offer their employees? Some of it ends up feeding those who need food in the Bay Area.

Most everyone knows about the abundance of free food at tech companies  a perk popularized by Google and others to attract talented workers with dining choices that make it unnecessary to leave campus.

From the South Bay to the Peninsula to San Francisco, these companies employ hundreds of thousands of employees in the Bay Area. Thats a lot of food and not all of it is consumed every day. What happens to whats left over at the end of each day?

Many of the companies donate their excess food, often through the outside caterers they use. Google, for example, donated nearly 60,000 pounds of food from January through October, spread out through different organizations.

But Facebook, among the biggest and most high-profile of Silicon Valley tech giants that gives its employees free food, does not donate its excess uneaten food.

Facebook cites health and liability concerns as reasons it does not donate excess food from the 21 cafes and five food trucks on its massive campus in Menlo Park, from where employees and their guests frequently post on social media photos of the meals they eat for free.

Julia Beal is a former chef at one of Facebooks many eateries.

I always felt they could use a kick in the butt regarding food waste but also understand there are health code restrictions/guidelines that are required to be followed, which I'm certain could be possible, Beal said. The raw-food chef said she was fortunate to work in the Living the Dream Cafe at Facebook in 2016 before moving to Indiana.

We are unable to donate our leftovers because of concerns around contamination and allergies, said Anthony Harrison, Facebook spokesman, on Friday. He said the company, which feeds 25,000 workers each day at its headquarters, tries to minimize our food waste by creatively recycling from one meal to the next - breakfast into lunch, lunch into dinner.

Many other tech companies donate their excess food, and there are laws that protect donors from liability when they give food to nonprofit organizations. For example, Chefs to End Hunger has recovered 282,135 pounds of food from Bay Area tech companies so far this year, according to Brette Waters, the nonprofits program director. That translates to about 235,000 meals, based on the USDA conversion rate of 1.2 pounds of food being equal to one meal, she said.

The food has come from Tesla, Uber, Oracle, Intuit, Yahoo, Nvidia, Genentech and other familiar names, she said.

Silicon Valley is where we see the highest numbers of recovered food, Waters said.

For years, the organization has provided free pickup services to donors, using refrigerated trucks, warehouses and other logistical services provided by LA & SF Specialty, a wholesale distributor of food and produce to California, Nevada, Arizona and Hawaii. The donated food is then distributed to organizations that give it to those in need. In the Bay Area, Chefs for Hunger gives all its donated food to Hope 4 the Heart, a Hayward-based nonprofit that provides food and other help to local families, churches, schools and other nonprofits.

Donated food is no small thing in a region where the cost of living is high, thanks largely to the tech boom, and where many residents are considered food insecure, the U.S. Department of Agricultures language for people who do not have regular access to food. In California, 1 in 8 residents are food insecure, according to the California Association of Food Banks.

What happens to excess food isnt just up to the tech companies. ZeroCater, in San Francisco, caters food to companies including Salesforce and Scribd. Its important for ZeroCater to reduce food waste and give back to the community, said spokeswoman Megan Palmer. So it works with organizations that donate to homeless shelters, after-school programs, veterans centers and more.

One of its partners is Re-Plate, which last year rerouted leftover meals to shelters and areas to feed those fighting, or displaced, by the Napa fires, Palmer said.

Another organization that handles donated food is San Francisco-based Food Runners. It relies on an army of volunteers to pick up excess prepared food from caterers, cafeterias and elsewhere, and delivers more than 20,000 meals to local food programs each week.

Food Runners regular donors include Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Square, Airbnb, Stripe and several other tech companies, said Nancy Hahn, operations manager for the nonprofit.

Meanwhile, Apple does not give free meals to all its employees, although some workers get a discount on food when they work late.еКApple tries to minimize waste by repurposing uneaten food into family meals for cafeteria staff, a company spokeswoman said. She said those meals feed hundreds of workers and their families.",254,,6-Dec-18,The Update;,516,"Daily Post (palo Alto, California)",News; Pg. 1,"The Update;

D1,"Google Landsale Backed By San Josecity Council;

The San Jose City Council early Wednesday approved a $110 million public land sale of 10 acres to Google, a key step to advance the tech giant's expansion plans that would transform the city's downtown, despite protests that led to arrests and a rare closing of the council's chambers.

After hours of debate that began Tuesday, the council voted unanimously after midnight for a plan by Google to bring around 20,000 jobs near Diridon Station by 2035, which would make it the city's largest private employer. Specific buildings haven't been proposed, and final approvals are expected to take years.

Dozens of residents expressed opposition, eloquent and profane, to Google's arrival in San Jose at a public hearing preceding the vote, underscoring the tension over tech's enormous growth in the region. Opponents said Google would exacerbate the city's housing costs and displace residents. They also criticized the company's lack of minority workers and questioned if the company would benefit local residents. Google said in its diversity report that 2.5 percent of employees are black and 3.6 percent are Latino.

""San Jose can't afford a Google deal that ignores tenants,"" Alejandra Mejia, a mother of three children who said she has lived in a homeless shelter, said at the hearing.

At one point, as council members prepared to cast their votes, opponents broke out in chants, prompting city leaders to put the meeting on hold for an hour. Some protestors chained themselves to seats until police officers used bolt cutters to separate them from the furniture. Eight protestors were arrested, police said.

City officials said the development would bring much-needed jobs to the city and boost tax revenue, without requiring public subsidies. The council is seeking 25 percent affordable housing as part of the project.

""San Jose is still technically a bedroom community,"" Kim Walesh, San Jose deputy city manager, said at the hearing. ""Our job growth has not kept pace.""

Walesh said the city has 0.81 jobs for each employed resident, the lowest ratio among any major U.S. city. More than 60 percent of employed San Jose residents commute out of the city for work, to destinations including Google's headquarters in Mountain View.

She said having Google as the single master developer would give the city more leverage in negotiating community benefits.

San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said at the hearing that the expansion would ""revitalize many dark corners of our downtown"" and that Google was a ""model community partner.""

Mark Golan, Google vice president of real estate and workplace services, said at the hearing that the company has been talking to community groups for 10 months and supports a deal with no tax subsidies and payment for additional community benefits.

Diridon Station is one of the Bay Area's largest transit hubs, with current service by Caltrain, Amtrak and VTA light rail, and a planned BART connection by 2026. The city passed its Diridon Station Area Plan in 2014, calling for over 5 million square feet of office space, more than 2,600 housing units, 420,000 square feet of retail and 900 hotel rooms. It isn't clear how many housing units Google will build, but the company has said residential development is a priority.

The project is expected to generate $8.5 million to $12.5 million in annual net tax revenue, plus $45 million to $69 million in new property tax revenue, according to a city-commissioned study.

Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a nonprofit trade association whose members include Google, found 68 percent of San Jose residents supported the project in a September poll. The South Bay Labor Council and Silicon Valley Rising found 63 percent of 400 San Jose voters surveyed supported the project in a poll released in February.

Project opponents said they want public land to be used for public housing and shelter for the homeless. Walesh, the deputy city manager, said Google building market-rate housing would help fund affordable housing.

Randy Musterer, owner of Sushi Confidential, a restaurant about a half mile from the planned project, voiced his support, saying Google's presence would help boost sales for small businesses. He said he would hire 50 people if the project moves forward.

HIGHLIGHT:еКIn an open letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, a group claiming to represent thousands of temporary and contract workers calls for better pay, benefits and respect from the tech titan.

AеК group claiming to represent Googles shadow workforce has launched an appeal to company Chief Executive Sundar Pichai in hopes of getting higher wages and equal benefits for thousands of temporary and contract workers.

In an open letter posted Wednesday on Medium, the temporary, vendor and contract workers (TVCs) say Googles silence has been deafening since approximately 20,000 such workers staged a walkout last month to protest what they called discrimination, racism, sexual harassment and a workplace culture that only works for some. The letter was addressed to Pichai and signed only by TVCs at Google.

Those behind the letter argue that there is, in effect, a caste system at Google that sets up its TVCs as second-class citizens who arent given the same respect as full-time Google employees.

We do essential work, from marketing, to running engineering teams, to feeding you and the rest of the Google staff?-?all without fair benefits or recognition. Google cannot function without us, said the open letter, which asserted that TVCs now make up the majority of the companys total workforce.

The TVCs called upon Google to provide better pay and access to benefits that meet the full-time employee standard, including high-quality healthcare, paid vacations, paid sick days, holiday pay, family leave, and bonuses, as well as a more-transparent process by which TVCs can convert to full-time employment.

The TVCs also said that Google doesnt give them enough, or appropriate information about matters at the company that have a direct effect on their jobs. Among the issues they raised was when an active shooter was on the Google campus in April, and they were left in the dark about the situation as it unfolded.

The company sent real-time security updates to full-time employees only, leaving TVCs defenseless in the line of fire, the letter stated. TVCs were then excluded from a town hall discussion the following day.

San Jose's Tuesday night City Council meeting on the planned sale of about 10 acres of publicly owned land in the city core turned raucous, with the hearing disrupted repeatedly, including by several protestors who chained themselves to seats at City Hall.

San Jose police department officers cut off the chains and arrested several protestors. The City Council took a recess, but was expected to return to debate the city's plan to sell parcels of land by Diridon Station to Google with the hope that the Mountain View-based tech giant will build a corporate campus that could eventually have more than 20,000 people working in the downtown area.

Proponents of the campus, including the South Bay's largest pro-business interests, have said it will provide a much-needed boost to San Jose, the only major Bay Area city that has more homes than jobs, and be the catalyst that drives a resurgence for the city's downtown.

But some community and housing advocates have said the massive campus risks displacing existing residents, especially low-income, elderly and other vulnerable members of the community, and that the city hasn't been transparent enough about its negotiations with Google.

The San Jose City Council early Wednesday morning voted unanimously to sell 10.5 acres of publicly owned land to Google near the city's downtown core, where the search giant wants to build a massive new mixed-use corporate campus.

The controversial vote to sell a spate of key properties around San Jose's Diridon Station came after about 10 hours of discussion, community testimony and multiple meeting-stopping protests over whether Alphabet-owned Google is the right buyer for the land.

Google leaders ahead of the vote told council members the company aims to be an integral part of the community.

""We've also heard the call for Google to act as part of the solution for concerns surrounding homelessness, job training, and investment in educational programs for San Jose's youth,"" Mark Golan, Google's vice president of real estate and workplace services for Northern California, said in a presentation to the council Tuesday. ""We remain committed to working with the community and the city to address each of these issues.""

Council members' vote to part with a set of key properties in exchange for nearly $110 million from Google is an early but significant milestone in a process that is expected to bring to the city a new 6 million- to 8 million-square-foot mixed-use Google campus. The potential project would also include retail, housing and bring as many as 20,000 new tech workers to the downtown over the next decade.

So far, the tech giant hasn't submitted any specific project plans, but boosters of the potential Google campus say the deal would be a boon to San Jose, which is one of the few cities in Silicon Valley with more employed residents than jobs. The city currently sits at a ratio of 0.81 jobs per employed resident in the city.

San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo and Santa Clara County leaders say the municipality needs more office space and jobs to bolster its tax base and provide basic services.

""For too long, San Jose has been the bedroom community to Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara and Cupertino,"" said County Assessor Larry Stone, a longtime politician who also served as the mayor of Sunnyvale in the past. ""Your vote is a step toward right-sizing our jobs to housing imbalance.""

But more than 100 passionate residents also showed up Tuesday night to say they fear a massive Google campus would bring devastating gentrification and displacement to the diverse South Bay city. Community members have held protests and two local advocacy groups last month filed a lawsuit against city over transparency concerns related to the negotiations with Google thus far.

On Tuesday night, the City Council's discussions over whether to sell the publicly owned land was halted for more than an hour after activists chained themselves to chairs in the council chambers and chanted in protest against the property sale.

San Jose resident Tori Truscheit, who rents a duplex next to the potential Google development, told council members that renters in the area would likely be displaced or priced out by the development of a new tech campus.

""We have no protection, so as you vote for this - which we all expect you to do - I want you to keep that on your conscience,"" she said. ""If there is no protection for any of the renters in my neighborhood, many of us, we don't know where else we're going to go.""

Land slated to be sold to Google includes about 6.5 acres owned by the Successor Agency to the Redevelopment Agency (SARA) and two city-owned properties: The Fire Training Center at 255 S. Montgomery St. and another small slice of property at 697 West San Carlos. The agreement also leaves open an option in the future for Google to buy another spate of city-owned parking lots that today serve sports fans during San Jose Sharks games.

Google won a major victory last night, when the San Jose City Council agreed to sell 10.5 acres of publicly owned land to the search giant that would be key slices of its potential new campus near the city's downtown.

But the city didn't only approve a land sale in its controversial vote Wednesday morning after 10 hours of debate, public comment and protests. Council members also agreed on a broad outline of expectations for a potential Google development and goals for the more than 230 acres around the city's primary transit hub, Diridon Station, which is slated to become much bigger and busier in the coming years.

The expectations, outlined in what is known as a Memorandum of Understanding with the Alphabet Inc.-owned search giant, evolved in the days leading up to the vote, as various council members published joint and independent memos of what they'd want in a new Google Campus spanning up to 8 million square feet in size.

In those documents, elected officials focused on local housing affordable and ensuring that San Jose residents get a shot at being one of the 15,000 to 20,000 Google employees on the site.

The end result includes compromises of all of the council members' memos, and sheds light on what the community can expect to see in the coming years as Google puts together a master plan for a multi-phase, mixed-use project and the city updates its zoning in the area to allow for such a development.

Below are two of the biggest takeaways from the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) passed along with a ballyhooed land sale that paves the way for Google's future in downtown San Jose.

Reconvening the Station Area Advisory Group

The MOU asks that the 38-member Station Area Advisory Group be brought back together. The advisory group is made up of representatives from Google, Adobe Systems, multiple neighborhood associations, local school districts and conservation groups.

That group was formed to provide community and stakeholder feedback on the MOU passed this week as well as future zoning changes to the area as the city prepares for redevelopment. The group's last meeting was in early October. The just-passed agreement asks that the advisory group now be used to ""provide feedback in a public forum on a final community benefits and development agreement(s) prior to any council decision.""

Aspiring for 25 percent affordability

San Jose officials kept in an initiative to mandate that 25 percent of the total number of new homes built in the Diridon Station Area will be considered affordable to people who are considered extremely low income all the way to ""the missing middle"" income earners.

This promise, aimed at addressing deep community concerns around displacement through redevelopment and rising rents, is a controversial proposal for the development community, which is also grappling with rising costs for land and construction in the area.

The council plans to revisit a residential cost of development study released earlier this year to help guide efforts to increase housing and allow for more affordable housing in the area.

San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo wants to make one thing abundantly clear: His negotiations with Google have looked nothing like AmazonМў(EURO)(TM)s deal with its new headquarters host cities, which offered a combined $3 billion in tax breaks to harpoon it.When Google expressed interest in building a new, sprawling tech campus in downtown San Jose for the first time in early 2017, Liccardo says, the city didnМў(EURO)(TM)t offer the company any tax incentives in exchange for its business. Мў(EURO)oeMore importantly,Мў(EURO) he added in a Medium post, Мў(EURO)oeGoogle never asked for a dime.Мў(EURO) Instead, Google was drawn to the region for its plan to develop Diridon Station, an ambitious transit center that will eventually connect seven lines, including high-speed rail, BART, Caltrain, and VTA. Мў(EURO)oeGoogle was smart enough to figure out where the puck was going on the ice, and to skate to it,Мў(EURO) Liccardo told CityLab.Years after those initial talks, the deal for a San Jose Google Village is getting closer to closing. According to a Memorandum of Understanding between San Jose and the company, Google has agreed to pay the city $111 million in exchange for more than a dozen downtown parcels that cover 10.5 acres of land, with the option of buying 11 additional acres in the future.

On December 4, San JoseМў(EURO)(TM)s city council will take its first vote on the sale. If green-lit, the companyМў(EURO)(TM)s entrance will fundamentally alter the Silicon Valley cityМў(EURO)(TM)s landscape, adding 15,000 to 20,000 Google jobs; growing the cityМў(EURO)(TM)s downtown workforce by an estimated 65 percent; and bound to create Мў(EURO)oea lot more of everything,Мў(EURO) as Scott Knies, executive director of of the San Jose Downtown Association, put it to the Mercury News. To ease the transition, the city and the company are working out the details of what they expect will be a robust community benefits agreement, meant to hold Google to building affordable housing near transit, and supporting the cityМў(EURO)(TM)s existing workforce and infrastructure. Мў(EURO)oeAmazon is not unique,Мў(EURO) says Liccardo. Мў(EURO)oeFoxconn extracted billions from Minnesota; Tesla got billions out of Nevada, this is not new.Мў(EURO) But, he says, those dealsrepresent the past far more than the future. Мў(EURO)oeWhat I hope that we have shown is that cities can chart a different course.Мў(EURO)The dealМў(EURO)(TM)s positioning as an antidote to the flashy Hunger Games-style competition that led Amazon to Long Island City and Northern Virginia is not without merit, as even some tech development skeptics agree.Мў(EURO)oeI have been really impressed at GoogleМў(EURO)(TM)s response and their commitment to the process,Мў(EURO) said Teresa Alvarado, San Jose director of SPUR, a Bay Area nonprofit focused on equitable urban planning. Мў(EURO)oeThey have shown up, theyМў(EURO)(TM)ve been consistent, theyМў(EURO)(TM)ve had people there responding to questions, theyМў(EURO)(TM)ve been open to feedbackМў(EURO)""and IМў(EURO)(TM)ve seen them incorporate some of the feedback in their plans.Мў(EURO)But the agreement hasnМў(EURO)(TM)t been immune to criticism. While Google wonМў(EURO)(TM)t get outright public subsidies, as Liccardo noted, the company will benefit as much as the community from Diridon Station, which will cost taxpayers $10 billion. While San Jose is already home to almost half of GoogleМў(EURO)(TM)s Mountain View employeesМў(EURO)""Мў(EURO)oeItМў(EURO)(TM)s not like this is suddenly a brave new world for San Jose,Мў(EURO) Liccardo saidМў(EURO)""serving as a bedroom community for tech workers has already strained the regionМў(EURO)(TM)s affordability, with the median housing price nearing $1 million this year. A ballot initiative known as Measure V, which would have put $450 million towards funding affordable housing in the city, failed in the midterms.And, while surveys have shown strong community support for the development (about two-thirds of those surveyed by the Silicon Valley Leadership Group in September approved of the transit village), two non-profits have sued the city for signing non-disclosure agreements with Google.The Memorandum of Understanding and other land sale documents were released last month, disclosing the deal price and other basic parameters of the agreement, meaning the public already knows far more than residents in Long Island City and Northern Virginia ever knew about the Amazon deal before it was announced.But the NDA ensures that more detailed communications about the deal between the city and the company have not been made public. The plaintiffs hope to force their release through a court order,arguing that Мў(EURO)oeSan JoseМў(EURO)(TM)s municipal code Мў(EURO)е_ restricts officials from entering into contracts without council approval, and violate state law barring agencies from letting outside parties control disclosures to the public,Мў(EURO) according to an account of the filing in Bloomberg. A lawyer for San Jose contends that the NDAs are valid.Мў(EURO)oeIt raises questions about who is actually negotiating this deal,Мў(EURO) says Jeffrey Buchanan, the policy director of Working Partnerships USA, one of the non-profits involved in the lawsuit. Мў(EURO)oeWhy is the public not a part of conversations, and what does this mean for the future of public land sales in California?Мў(EURO) (Google says it has spent more than 150 hours holding more than 30 meetings with several community groups and local organizations over the last year.)Already, Мў(EURO)oeyou have thousands of janitors, cafeteria workers, and shuttle bus workers that donМў(EURO)(TM)t make enough to live in the Valley,Мў(EURO) says Buchanan. Мў(EURO)oeThey live 2 hours away; they live in garages, and sleep in their cars.Мў(EURO) Berlin just rejected a 32,000 square foot Google campus, citing similar fears of gentrification and displacement.And itМў(EURO)(TM)s not just high housing prices opponents dread: Silicon Valley Rising, another non-profit that advocates for inclusive tech development, along with Buchanan, have called for an end to GoogleМў(EURO)(TM)s hiring of subcontractors with poor wages and benefits; and would want Google to commit both to local hiring in San Jose, and to Мў(EURO)oeresponsible contracting standards.Мў(EURO)But Liccardo believes Google could be part of the key to solving some of San JoseМў(EURO)(TM)s existing problems, and that the city can hold them to playing that role. Мў(EURO)oeSan Jose has the worst jobs-housing balance of any city in the country, even though weМў(EURO)(TM)re in the middle of Silicon Valley,Мў(EURO) he says. Мў(EURO)oeThe tendency for those cities has been to add multi-million square foot campuses, and not to add more housing.Мў(EURO) ThatМў(EURO)(TM)s meant San Jose, one of the few Silicon Valley cities without a tech campus to call its own already, has absorbed the brunt of the commuters. ItМў(EURO)(TM)s the Мў(EURO)oeonly major U.S. city that has a higher population at night than it does during the day,Мў(EURO) according to CNBC.To ensure housing supply adapts to the growing demand, the city council says it will push the company to agree that 25 percent of the housing built near the Diridon Station be affordable, and rent-restricted. Liccardo says the council is also considering imposing a commercial linkage fee for all businesses in the downtown corridor, which would be used for affordable housing development, too. Мў(EURO)oeThey seem to agree in concept to that notion,Мў(EURO) he said. Мў(EURO)oeObviously, we have to agree on the price.Мў(EURO)In the Memorandum of Understanding, the city also alludes to further community benefits, which will be calculated based on perks San Jose gives to Google via city entitlements and land use titles: Allowing the company to maximize building heights, for example, could translate into funding for San JoseМў(EURO)(TM)s youth tech training programs. In other words, if the city is asked to give more to Google, Google would have a reciprocal obligation to give more to the city.And though the city and state have committed to funding Diridon Station without any Google money, the fate of the project rests solidly on GoogleМў(EURO)(TM)s planned expansion, said Liccardo and several others CityLab spoke to.Мў(EURO)oeWithout a big anchor like Google it would be a matter of trying to piece [funding] together, with much less momentum, parcel by parcel and business by business,Мў(EURO) said Jason Baker, the vice president of transportation, housing & community development for the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. Мў(EURO)oeThere couldnМў(EURO)(TM)t be a better place to put this urban village.Мў(EURO)When itМў(EURO)(TM)s finished, 600 trains are expected to travel through the station, transporting 140,000 people a day. Google has expressed interest in being involved with the design of the station itself, says Liccardo, which has been described aspirationally as the Мў(EURO)oeGrand Central of the West.Мў(EURO)Concentrating growth around transit nodes like this is a Мў(EURO)oewin-win-win,Мў(EURO) Alvarado says: It will help relieve congestion and traffic, help the state meet significant climate goals, and could create more office cultures dependent on transit, not automobiles. Мў(EURO)oeIf we can draw some of those folks that have a reverse commute, and connect them with transit services, it gives people a lot more mobility and job options,Мў(EURO) she said. Мў(EURO)oeItМў(EURO)(TM)s a total game changer.Мў(EURO)Working PartnershipМў(EURO)(TM)s Buchanan agrees that the transit center will be transformativeМў(EURO)""and it will likely increase the value of the land surrounding it exponentially in the next decade. But that means San Jose should be holding out for more much more than $111 million for the land, he says.Google will pay $237.50 per square foot for the land, according to the Memorandum of Understanding,which Liccardo writes is Мў(EURO)oe2.5 times more than what some neighboring properties were appraised at just a year ago.Мў(EURO) But Google just paid $1 billion to expand its Mountain View campus; and $2.4 billion to buy out the Chelsea Market building, home to its office in New York.Мў(EURO)oeThe dollar value sounds high, but there will be a lot of costs for the city to restore buildings itМў(EURO)(TM)s selling,Мў(EURO) said Buchanan. Among other properties, the city is selling its fire training center to Google for up to $42.9 million, and the company will then lease it back to the city for zero dollars for three years, while the city tries to find another plot of land. Мў(EURO)oeAfter the three-year period, if the City still needs the land for a Fire Training Center and Google is not yet ready to proceed with the development, then Google and the City could negotiate a new lease for the property,Мў(EURO) said a spokesperson for the mayorМў(EURO)(TM)s office in an email.ItМў(EURO)(TM)s parsing details like this that might make the city council vote this week contentious, though many expect the sale to go through smoothly. After the purchase agreement comes the negotiations over community benefits, and then an estimated decade of gradual growth if the full package goes through.Мў(EURO)oeThere are advocates in our community that simply believe more tech is evil because it contributes to higher housing costs,Мў(EURO) Liccardo says. Мў(EURO)oeI understand and appreciate the amount of pain that people are suffering right now. But itМў(EURO)(TM)s a little like saying food is bad for the body because it causes obesity.

Colliers International group is gearing up to combine three Silicon Valley offices into a high-rise downtown San Jose tower as company leaders look ahead to the coming decade of expected growth in the city.

The brokerage is slated to move into 25,000 square feet at the 16-story building at 225 W. Santa Clara St. in February, pulling people out of a small Mountain View office and two downtown San Jose locations to consolidate its teams into what has become a booming South Bay downtown core. The move will also place the brokerage in the same building as competitor CBRE.

Among the Colliers offices to be left behind: Its nearly 20-year home at 450 W. Santa Clara St., which sits in the middle of Google's plotted path to build a massive new tech campus next to the city's major transit hub. Google bought the property last year as details were coming to light about it's interest in the city's downtown.

Though Colliers has another year on its lease and an option to extend its presence in the building for another decade, company leaders say Google was open to tearing up the agreement early. Plus, the new office will offer the brokerage a competitive edge in terms of recruiting new talent, Reed Payne, executive managing director for Colliers International, said in an interview last week.

""From my perspective, this office gives us the ability to prepare for the next 10 to 15 years of Colliers,"" he said. ""It's in a high-rise building, it's in a downtown environment, there's residential ... services and restaurants, nightlife and culture all the way around us.""

Overall, Colliers will downsize its Silicon Valley footprint, shrinking from about 36,000 square feet across the three offices to about 25,000 in downtown San Jose, even as it continues to grow its headcount and branch into more full-service brokerage opportunities.

""It's going to be a lot more open space from the floor plan so a lot fewer private offices, and that might affect some people,"" Colliers Research Manager Lena Tutko said. ""But with all our product groups on one floor, we are expecting a lot more collaborating.""

Currently, the group takes up nearly 23,000 square feet at 450 W. Santa Clara St., and 4,400 square feet at 2570 W. El Camino Real in Mountain View. The company is also in about 9,000 square feet at 1 Almaden Blvd., which is a former Colliers Parrish corporate office from before Colliers International bought the independent brokerage two years ago.

Despite the reduction in square feet, Payne says Colliers is still growing its employee count in downtown San Jose, an area the veteran broker has watched evolve from a quiet, often overlooked area, to downright booming over the last 20 years.

""It's night and day from 1997 to today, and in such a positive vein,"" Payne said of San Jose's downtown core. ""It's only getting bigger and better from my perspective, and I'm just excited that we're going to be in the middle of it and be a part of it.""

P6b,"Church Parking Lot Is Briefly Home For Californians Living In Cars

SARATOGA, Calif. - In the two years that John slept in his car on the streets of San Francisco, he saw some scary things.

There was the woman beaten in the middle of the street, the drug users and dealers who slunk past his windows, the thieves who gave him a warning eye as they moved stolen electronics around his vehicle. Harassed by police and some residents, he was constantly moving from curb to curb, all while working full time to pay off the car he was living in.

""It is really a dangerous place, John, 44, said on a recent evening as he hung blackout curtains - repurposed hair salon smocks - in his black 2015 Prius, parked in a corner of a church parking lot in this suburb an hour south of San Francisco. ""But being here gives me a feeling of being settled. I don't have to sleep with one eye open anymore.

John, who gave only his first name to maintain his privacy about being homeless, is one of about 15 people enrolled in a new program that provides secure overnight parking and other services to Bay Area residents who live in their vehicles. Saratoga's interfaith program, started in the spring by seven local congregations and a community college, is one of a growing number of ""safe park programs across the San Francisco Bay area, where the exorbitant cost of housing has forced many onto the streets.

Drugs and weapons are not allowed at these sites, and most provide a security guard. Most of the congregations open their buildings to their guests for a couple of hours, providing bathrooms, recharging stations and sometimes a kitchen and, as in Saratoga, a weekly meal. There may also be gas cards and gift cards to coffeehouses or retail stores.

""We are used to going outside the church to help the homeless, said Finny Abraham, an associate pastor at WestGate Church, where John spends his November nights. (The Saratoga congregations rotate the program monthly to comply with local parking laws.) ""But bringing them in gave us a chance to humanize the problem. And we learned these are people who all have a story, all have ambitions about the future and all have dreams. Like us, they are all on a path to those dreams.

Last year, the National Alliance to End Homelessness counted more than 553,000 people in the United States without housing. A quarter of those live in California, despite its booming economy, record low unemployment and the massive wealth generated by Silicon Valley, where Saratoga is located.

The problem - largely caused by a lack of affordable housing and skyrocketing housing costs - is exacerbated by recent wildfires that left tens of thousands of northern Californians homeless. When this month's Camp Fire leveled the town of Paradise, it displaced upward of 20,000 people, while last year's Napa and Sonoma fires destroyed or damaged almost 10,000 homes.

As they often do in hard times, houses of worship stepped in. In Chico, a hub for Paradise refugees, churches have opened their buildings and parking lots as temporary shelters.

But while those churches have been lauded, congregations in other areas that open their parking lots to those they sometimes refer to as ""vehicle residents face hurdles and hostility. Many Bay Area municipalities, including the tech centers of San Francisco and San Jose, have outlawed sleeping in a car parked on the street overnight, while neighbors speak out against having the homeless next door.

Some residents of Mountain View, 11 miles north of Saratoga and home to Google, vehemently opposed the expansion of ""Lots of Love, a safe-parking program, from two local churches to three. The opposition led the third church to bow out of the program.

And in Los Angeles, where advocates for the homeless estimate that 9,000 residents live in their cars, the faith-based founders of Safe Parking L.A. thought they would have no trouble enlisting congregations. But to date, they have only two.

""Faith organizations have a misperception about who we are attracting, said Scott Sale, who co-founded Safe Parking L.A. with leaders from churches and synagogues. ""They are people just like you and me. Ninety-nine percent of the people we work with are not criminals and never were.

Sale now woos potential faith-based partners to St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Koreatown, where 15 spaces are given to vehicle residents nightly.

""We have to go slowly, he said.

Other safe-parking programs have had a smoother route. Santa Barbara's New Beginnings Safe Parking Program launched in 2004 with a handful of spaces and has expanded to 24 lots with 133 spaces; 13 of the lots belong to houses of worship.

""Our program has been very successful by just being quiet, program director Cassie Roach said. ""Most of our lots have just four or six [safe parking] spaces, so you can walk by the lots every night and have no idea they are there.

Faith-based groups running safe-parking programs from San Diego to Seattle include Christian, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim and Mormon partners. A multifaith group in Oakland, where homelessness has grown 25 percent since 2015, just received a $300,000 city grant to start a safe-parking program in early 2019.

""Our Gospel tells us to welcome the stranger, to take care of the widows and orphans, said Karina O'Malley, the safe-parking coordinator at Lake Washington United Methodist Church in Kirkland, Washington. ""To me, it is such a gift to the congregation because proximity is the thing that is so desperately needed to awaken our souls and is so hard to get. It just enriches our experience of what needs to be happening in the world.

Lake Washington's program is for women and children only. Some are fleeing domestic violence; some lost their homes after a debilitating illness; some are simply priced out of the housing market. There are women-only lots in Mountain View, San Jose and Santa Barbara.

Sara Rankin is the director of the Homeless Rights Advocacy Project at Seattle University School of Law, a Jesuit school, and author of a report on faith-based safe-parking programs. She said no one is certain how many of these programs exist but they seem to be limited to the West Coast, where temperatures seldom dip below freezing.

""Virtually every religion has some sort of focus on ministering to the poor, she said. ""But it is a head-scratcher to me how so many faith communities have issues not just with vehicle residents, but also immigrants and refugees. We are not always consistent in what we profess our faith to be and what that faith compels us to do.

The vast majority of guests are like John - with a full- or part-time job to go to when they leave the parking lots around 6 a.m.

""There is just such a community here, John said after a meal of chicken and vegetables provided by a church member that he shared with volunteers and other parking lot guests, including a 70-year-old woman who gives Spanish lessons. ""The churches have helped us become a cohesive group. We've gotten to know each other, and we all look out for each other.

But there is no proselytizing - John identifies as an atheist and says none of the congregations where he parks have ever made him uncomfortable.

The volunteers said their own spiritual paths are enriched through their encounters with safe-parking guests. Dawn Kaltenbach, who shared dinner and a chat with John, said she comes to eat with the residents because ""this is where our faith gets real.

Then she adds, ""I am just one 60-day notice away from living out of my car myself.",265,Pierluigi Oliverio,1-Dec-18,Opinion: Google Plan Will Help San Jose Fix 42-year-old Problem,694,The East Bay Times (california),,"Opinion: Google Plan Will Help San Jose Fix 42-year-old Problem

HIGHLIGHT:еКNo other company could bring about such a positive economic development without taxpayer subsidies

In 1976, Mayor Janet Gray Hayes announced that the biggest challenge facing San Jose was the city's jobs-housing imbalance. 42 years later, little has changed. San Jose only has .85 jobs per employed resident, while neighboring cities have as many as 3 jobs per employed resident.

The number of jobs a city has directly translates into tax revenue for residents. For example, Palo Alto rakes in $407 per capita tax revenue, while the same calculation for San Jose equals only $140. Cities cannot provide services based on goodwill and good intentions, and instead must rely solely on tax revenue to pave roads, deploy police officers and keep libraries open.

San Jose has historically excelled in one area in particular, to our own economic detriment: It is the most generous city in providing housing stock for the entire region. Other cities built scant housing and instead focused on commercial development, which brings in substantial tax revenue to pay for city services.

For most of my own career, I have commuted outside of San Jose for work, as do 60 percent of our employed residents.еК Not only does commuting take away from family life and contribute to traffic congestion, when consumer spending occurs in other cities, San Jose also loses out on tax revenue to help our neighborhoods.

In 1984, the San Jose Redevelopment Agency sent a representative to visit my school to present a three-dimensional, visionary model of what downtown would look like in the future. The goal was to create a job-centric downtown, so people could live and work in the same city, and future buildings would be thoughtfully designed to coalesce around a true city center, adjacent to mass transit. As a middle-school student, I found the vision to be inspiring, and still support such goals today.

Presently, San Jose has an opportunity with Google to enable what has been envisioned for decades. Unlike other companies, Google is requesting absolutely no taxpayer subsidy from our city.еК This is unprecedented, and we'd be foolish to pass up a partnership with such an established, forward thinking, well capitalized company. The proposed downtown office development would be accessible to the public, and would combine thoughtfully designed, environmentally mindful architecture with landscaped pedestrian and bike paths connected to the rest of downtown and mass transit.

Despite the symbiotic, smart growth opportunity that the Google partnership presents, some have been trying to raise fear, uncertainty and doubt about this project for a myriad of reasons. Google has many viable options for expansion locally, nationally and globally, and vilifying the company only serves as an incentive for them to go elsewhere.

Google has approximately 4 million square feet of entitled unoccupied office space in Mountain View and Sunnyvale. If San Jose is perceived as too difficult, Google will simply expand elsewhere.еК Our neighbors will still have long commutes, we will forgo additional tax revenue, and downtown will continue to limp along with piecemeal development.еК When Adobe, Cisco and IBM located to San Jose, they ultimately employed thousands of our residents, to our great collective benefit.еК These companies contributed mightily to San Jose, as would Google.еК Why should San Jose treat Google any differently?

So the question remains: if not now, then when?еК If not Google, then who?еК There is no other company that could bring about such a positive economic and environmentally beneficial development without taxpayer subsidies.еК If we miss this opportunity, the land may remain vacant for decades, and the next generation of San Jose middle school students will be doomed to an adulthood of long commutes and lackluster city services.

When this month's Camp Fire levelled the town of Paradise, it displaced upward of 20,000 people, while last year's Napa and Sonoma fires destroyed or damaged almost 10,000 homes.

As they often do in hard times, houses of worship stepped in. In Chico, a hub for Paradise refugees, churches have opened their buildings and parking lots as temporary shelters.

But while those churches have been lauded, congregations in other areas that open their parking lots to those they sometimes refer to as ""vehicle residents"" face hurdles and hostility. Many Bay Area municipalities, including the tech centres of San Francisco and San Jose, have outlawed sleeping in a car parked on the street overnight, while neighbours speak out against having the homeless next door.

Some residents of Mountain View, 11 miles north of Saratoga and home to Google, vehemently opposed the expansion of ""Lots of Love,"" a safe-parking program, from two local churches to three. The opposition led the third church to bow out of the program.

And in Los Angeles, where advocates for the homeless estimate that 9,000 residents live in their cars, the faith-based founders of Safe Parking L.A. thought they would have no trouble enlisting congregations. But to date, they have only two. ""Faith organizations have a misperception about who we are attracting,"" said Scott Sale, who co-founded Safe Parking L.A. with leaders from churches and synagogues.

SARATOGA, Calif. ? In the two years that John slept in his car on the streets of San Francisco, he saw some scary things.

There was the woman beaten in the middle of the street, the drug users and dealers who slunk past his windows, the thieves who gave him a warning eye as they moved stolen electronics around his vehicle. Harassed by police and some residents, he was constantly moving from curb to curb, all while working full time to pay off the car he was living in.

""It is really a dangerous place,"" John, 44, said on a recent evening as he hung blackout curtains - repurposed hair salon smocks - in his black 2015 Prius, parked in a corner of a church parking lot in this suburb an hour south of San Francisco. ""But being here gives me a feeling of being settled. I don't have to sleep with one eye open anymore.""

John, who gave only his first name to maintain his privacy about being homeless, is one of about 15 people enrolled in a new program that provides secure overnight parking and other services to Bay Area residents who live in their vehicles. Saratoga's interfaith program, started in the spring by seven local congregations and a community college, is one of a growing number of ""safe park"" programs across the San Francisco Bay area, where the exorbitant cost of housing has forced many onto the streets.

Drugs and weapons are not allowed at these sites, and most provide a security guard. Most of the congregations open their buildings to their guests for a couple of hours, providing bathrooms, recharging stations and sometimes a kitchen and, as in Saratoga, a weekly meal. There may also be gas cards and gift cards to coffeehouses or retail stores.

""We are used to going outside the church to help the homeless,"" said Finny Abraham, an associate pastor at WestGate Church, where John spends his November nights. (The Saratoga congregations rotate the program monthly to comply with local parking laws.) ""But bringing them in gave us a chance to humanize the problem. And we learned these are people who all have a story, all have ambitions about the future and all have dreams. Like us, they are all on a path to those dreams.""

Last year, the National Alliance to End Homelessness counted more than 553,000 people in the United States without housing. A quarter of those live in California, despite its booming economy, record low unemployment and the massive wealth generated by Silicon Valley, where Saratoga is located.

Sale now woos potential faith-based partners to St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Koreatown, where 15 spaces are given to vehicle residents nightly.

""We have to go slowly,"" he said.

Faith-based groups running safe-parking programs from San Diego to Seattle include Christian, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim and Mormon partners. A multi-faith group in Oakland, where homelessness has grown 25 per cent since 2015, just received a $300,000 city grant to start a safe-parking program in early 2019.

""Our Gospel tells us to welcome the stranger, to take care of the widows and orphans,"" said Karina O'Malley, the safe-parking coordinator at Lake Washington United Methodist Church in Kirkland, Washington. ""To me, it is such a gift to the congregation because proximity is the thing that is so desperately needed to awaken our souls and is so hard to get. It just enriches our experience of what needs to be happening in the world.""

Lake Washington's program is for women and children only. Some are fleeing domestic violence; some lost their homes after a debilitating illness; some are simply priced out of the housing market. There are women-only lots in Mountain View, San Jose and Santa Barbara.

Sara Rankin is the director of the Homeless Rights Advocacy Project at Seattle University School of Law, a Jesuit school, and author of a report on faith-based safe-parking programs. She said no one is certain how many of these programs exist but they seem to be limited to the West Coast, where temperatures seldom dip below freezing. ""Virtually every religion has some sort of focus on ministering to the poor,"" she said. !@COPYRIGHT=е© 2018 Times &; Transcript (Moncton)",268,"Marisa Kendall, The Mercury News (tns)",30-Nov-18,World's Largest Dorm-style 'co-living' Apartment Building Coming To San Jose,847,"The Pioneer (big Rapids, Michigan)",News; Pg. C2,"World's Largest Dorm-style 'co-living' Apartment Building Coming To San Jose

SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The latest trendy new apartment building coming to downtown San Jose will offer plenty of luxury amenities, including cleaning services, laundry and dog walking. The catch? Each resident will share a kitchen and living room with at least a dozen other strangers.

The nearly 800-unit building, set to break ground early next year, is the latest project to embrace ""co-living"" -- a dorm-like set-up where residents sleep in small private bedrooms and share common spaces, as a way to pack more people into a building and keep rents down. It's a lifestyle that's becoming increasingly popular as Bay Area residents, grappling with sky-high housing costs, are forced to find ever-more creative ways to stay afloat, and developers are encouraged to come up with innovative methods to house more people faster.

The San Jose project will be the largest co-living building in the world, according to its developer, San Francisco-based communal housing startup Starcity. The company also has a 270-unit co-living building in the works in San Francisco's SoMa neighborhood. The two projects, both slated to open in 2021, will be the startup's first attempts at building from the ground up instead of renovating existing buildings. Together they mark a major expansion by Starcity, and would increase the company's existing inventory by more than 10-fold.

""I think about actually making a dent in the supply to the point where people who are somewhere else in the country, or living nearby, or commuting hours and hours and hours can say, 'OK now there's a way for me to get into the city,'"" said Starcity co-founder and CEO Jon Dishotsky. ""Commuting is a pain in the butt, fitting four people to a two-bedroom is a pain in the butt and paying 70 percent of your income is not enjoyable.""

Starcity, which originally bought empty or underutilized residential and commercial buildings and turned them into housing, made its co-housing debut by converting a Victorian house and garage into a six-unit shared living space in San Francisco in 2016. Now the startup operates 81 units in five buildings -- four in San Francisco and one in Los Angeles. In the next year, the company plans to finish another 600 units in San Francisco and more than 400 in Los Angeles.

The co-living trend is part of a broader creative movement sweeping the Bay Area's housing market. Entrepreneurs are finding a range of innovative solutions to the region's housing shortage -- from turning shipping containers into tiny homes, to building micro-houses in people's backyards, to providing new ways for renters to build equity and save for down payments.

""People are rethinking how to live, and what housing means, and how it's provided,"" said Chris Calott, a development and architecture professor at UC Berkeley.

Starcity's upcoming San Jose building, located at 199 Bassett -- three blocks from the Diridon Caltrain station, near where Google has proposed a new campus for up to 20,000 workers -- will have up to 790 units. Each renter will have his or her own private bedroom and adjoining bathroom, or will share a bathroom with a family member or pre-selected friend. Between 12 and 18 people will share each kitchen and living room, and there will be four kitchens and living rooms per floor.

Both the San Jose building and the San Francisco building will cater to residents making between $40,000 and $120,000 a year. Rooms likely will rent for $800 to $2,500 -- below the current market rates for one-bedroom apartments in both cities.

The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Jose is $2,364, according to RentCafe. It's $3,261 in San Francisco.

Starcity can keep its costs down because its properties are more dense, Dishotsky said. By removing a building's living rooms, kitchens and hallways and turning them into bedrooms, Starcity can fit more people into the building, collect rent from more tenants, and lower everyone's prices.

Even so, Starcity's price tags likely puts its rooms out of reach for many local residents.

""When you're co-housing and you're still paying $2,000 for a room, that's not sustainable,"" said Kate Comfort Harr, executive director of San Mateo County-based nonprofit HIP Housing. ""It might be part of the solution, but at that price point it's only going to be a solution for a very few.""

Don Row, a 43-year-old pilot, moved into a room in a San Francisco Starcity building in February, after striking out trying to find a roommate on Craigslist as he prepared to relocate to the Bay Area from Phoenix. Row, who says he moved for the weather, now pays $2,200 a month for a private bedroom and two kitchens he shares with 10 other people.

Row admits he hadn't always pictured himself ending up in a dorm-style apartment in his 40s, and he doesn't necessarily think he'll live there forever. But for now, his only complaint is a lack of shelf space in the communal refrigerators.

""It is definitely not a traditional path by any stretch of the imagination,"" Row said. ""I can see why some people might think it would be weird. At the same time, I am loving it.""",269,Maria Noel Fernandez,30-Nov-18,Guest Opinion: Why The San Jose-google Plan Is A 'bad Deal',727,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Guest Opinion: Why The San Jose-google Plan Is A 'bad Deal'

Editor's note: The following guest column from Maria Noel Fernandez from Working Partnerships USA and Silicon Valley Rising is part of a series of op-eds the Silicon Valley Business Journal is running to get perspectives about Google's plans to purchase land in downtown San Jose. Read all the viewpoints here. To offer your take, send an email to svbjnews@bizjournals.com.

San Jose is at a crucial decision point where we, as a city, decide whether the new Google development will become a project that we can all be proud of - or a development with a legacy of displacement and gentrification.

When Google announced plans to build a new campus in downtown San Jose, many residents feared the latter. And they worried that the only Google jobs they may have a shot at would be poverty wage janitorial, cafeteria and security work at a time when mostеКare struggling to hang on.

After seeing how the land sale with Google is shaping up, I fear thisеКmay be a bad deal across the board.

Despite the city's contention that Google will improve San Jose's finances, this deal falls short.еКAfter selling land near Diridon Station to Google, Mayor Sam Liccardo will still need to spend tens of millions of dollars replacingеКwhat he just sold. San Jose will still need a fire training center, new parking facilities for the area,еКand replacement parks - and land for these will need to be bought at new Google-inflated prices.

ReplacingеКthis infrastructure will be expensive and, in a worst-case scenario, could cost more than what Google has offered to pay the city for our land. The deal is not billions of dollars in corporate subsidies that other cities have offered Amazon for its HQ2 development, but a public land sale to Google that could end up losing the city money is not exactly a great deal for San Jose, either.

San Jose officials predict between $6 million to $8 million a year in extra tax revenues from Google's Diridon-area project, equal to aboutеК0.6 percent of the city's general fund today. The benefits of this revenue pale in comparison to the addedеКrents working families and business owners will face as a result of Google coming to San Jose.

We need to bring these negotiations out from behind closed doors and bring the voices of thoseеКmost impacted by the project into the center of the debate if we want the city's leaders to negotiateеКa good deal for the people of San Jose. If the city of Mountain View can get Google to pay $100еКper square foot for community benefits or cities like Oakland can get agreements on local hiringеКand protections for family-supporting wages and a voice at work, why should San Jose sell itselfеКshort?

The city's memorandum of understanding with Google leaves the biggest questions unanswered:

еб    Will Google make investments to mitigate its impact on unaffordable housing and gridlockedеКtraffic? еб    Will Google ensure all the jobs on campus are good jobs? еб    Will Google address theеКdisproportionate impact of this project on women and people of color?

We need to hold Google accountable for a plan that invests in our working families instead ofеКbringing more low-wage jobs, rent increases and homelessness.еКWe need Google to commit to local hiring and educational investments so today's students can getеКtomorrow's jobs. And we need agreements with Google to ensure the 8,000 to 10,000 contract serviceеКworkers who work at this campus aren't paid poverty wages and forced to live in cars.

Let's ensure those workers haveеКdignified, family-supporting jobs thanks to responsible contracting standards, livable wages,еКgood benefits and labor peace.

And let's require Google and other developers to make 25 percent of new housing units affordable to low-income families and use community benefits, commercial linkage fees and other revenues to buildеКand preserve thousands of affordable units.

The community needs to continue raising its voice to improve this deal so Google does not leaveеКour working families behind and San Jose is left with a development that can act as a model for responsible tech growth.

This is no longer just about Google. This is about San Jose. This is about what we want our community to be.

It's about the businesses we successfully attract to Silicon Valley's largest city, and how we help them grow. Because this, the health of the business community, is inextricable from the health of the larger community in which it lives.

Businesses provide jobs, goods, services and much needed revenue to our city; revenue that pays for city services, road repair, and safety. All of this impacts every single San Jose resident's quality of life.

The development concept being proposed by Google and the city of San Jose in the Diridon Station Area will not only add thousands of new jobs, but it will also add new housing units, many of them affordable, allowing employees to live close to their jobs.

These employees will no longer be getting on 280 or 101 to get to work. Instead, they'll be able to walk, bike, or ride public transit. This, of course, leads to happier employees, a better quality of life, and the ability to redirect the time and money spent in traffic back to the city around them.

Existing neighborhoods in the project area's peripheral will see themselves becoming interconnected to the city, the downtown and to each other. This will not be your typical corporate campus.

The many small businesses that call downtown San Jose home depend on a vibrant and thriving city core that includes both businesses with lots of employees, but also residents living nearby who can frequent their business at night and on the weekends.

We just watched other cities from all over the country fall all over themselves, offering millions of dollars in subsidies in an attempt to attract a new Amazon HQ2 campus with the promise of new jobs.

But here in San Jose, Google is coming willingly and has not asked for any financial subsidies. In fact, they have expressed an interest in helping to address many of the city's challenges and opportunities.

Building out the Diridon Station area and attracting an anchor business to spur the kind of growth we desire has always been part of San Jose's General Plan.

Google has yet to unveil a specific project plan, but the impact of their interest in expanding in downtown San Jose has been felt since their announcement in 2017.

More than $1.43 billion has been spent in the last 12 months in downtown property acquisitions. Some call it the Google effect. Business sees it for what it is: Smart investment into a city with so much potential - to be Silicon Valley's downtown - the region's center for jobs, housing, sports, entertainment, culture and the arts.еКEvery great region has a great downtown.

The City Council and staff should be pulling out all the stops to get this catalytic project out of the ground.еКThis is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Let's do this, not just for Google, but for San Jose.

HIGHLIGHT:еКMore than 165 million Americans shopped in stores and online from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, but data show a slight dip from last year, when holiday shoppers spent an average of about $20 more.

By Rachel Siegel | The Washington Post

Thanksgiving weekend food: diet-busting.

Thanksgiving weekend retail sales: record-breaking.

Thats the chorus being sung by retailers, industry groups and data firms tracking holiday sales between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. This season has been widely projected to reel in massive sales, thanks to rising consumer confidence, low unemployment and a solid economy. Add steep discounts, free shipping services and the aura around holiday shopping to the list, and you get a five-day bonanza that ended on a high note.

Top line: This was a very strong holiday weekend. And this was a very positive indicator of where were headed over the next four weeks, said Bill Thorne of the National Retail Federation.

More than 165 million Americans shopped in stores and online from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation. In that time, the average shopper spent $313.29 on gifts and other holiday items. The biggest spenders were older millennials and Gen X shoppers who spent $413.05 on average.

Still, NRFs data show a slight dip from last year, when 174 million Americans turned out over the same five-day period. In 2017, holiday shoppers spent an average of $335  about $20 more than this year.

But Thorne said the decrease is simply the result of a longer holiday season. There is an extra weekend between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared with last year, which could be prompting some shoppers to spread out their spending. And high consumer confidence means shoppers wont feel as pressured to snap up discounts on one weekend alone.

When the economy is good, theyre going to space it out, Thorne said.

Cyber Monday handed a major boon to sales: This year, a record $7.9 billion was spent online, according to data by Adobe Analytics. The increase of 19.3 percent from 2017 results made Cyber Monday the largest online shopping day ever in the United States, beating last years $6.6 billion record.

(If youre wondering just how much time it took shoppers to spend that much: Over 24 hours on Cyber Monday, Americans spent a combined 95 million hours  orеК11,000 years  shopping online.)

On Tuesday, Amazon announced that Cyber Monday was the single biggest shopping day in the companys history. On Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined, shoppers ordered more than 18 million toys and more than 13 million fashion items, the company said.

Still, its hard to parse just how much more in Cyber Monday sales Amazon reeled in this year because the company doesnt disclose that information, noted Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones.

Were they up 20 percent versus last year, or were they up 2 percent? Yarbrough said. You just dont know.

Amazon declined to answer specific questions on how much Cyber Monday sales grew in comparison to past years, or how much money was spent by Amazon shoppers on Cyber Monday.

Mobile shopping hit records of its own: Black Friday saw a record $2.1 billion of sales coming from smartphones. Taylor Schreiner, director of Adobe Digital Insights, said retailers know that most shoppers wont be coming to them through a mobile app. So instead, they have to focus on building their online platforms for smartphones. That can involve investing in artificial intelligence and other programs to help steer customers toward items theyre more likely to buy.

It seems to be working. Schreiner said that over the holiday weekend, shoppers got through the mobile order process 5 percent faster than they did in 2017.

Then again, many shoppers dont draw clear lines between when they shop on their phones, computers or in person. Orders placed online and then picked up in stores over the weekend saw a record 50 percent increase year over year, according to Adobe.

What is clear is that this line between online and offline is really blurring, Schreiner said.

Black Friday also saw a record $6.22 billion spent online  an increase of 23.6 percent over 2017 results, according to Adobe. Shoppers are growing more comfortable buying bigger ticket items online: Black Friday saw a record average order value of $146  up 8.5 percent year over year.

But Black Friday turned up early this year. Adobe found that online prices on Thanksgiving were as low as they were the next day. Consumers noticed: Thanksgiving Day is now the fasting-growing online shopping day, with a 28 percent increase over 2017 results, according to Adobe.

TV prices offer some insight into how retailers are timing their discounts. Using Oct. 31 as a benchmark, Schreiner said TV prices were discounted an average of 4.7 percent the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. On the holiday, they were down about 18 percent  and stayed there through the weekend.

Despite strong holiday sales numbers, retailers may soon face a test, said Rod Sides, Deloittes retail practice leader. If the country were to face an economic slowdown in 2019 or beyond, retailers would have to find new ways to stay competitive. That could involve reassessing strategies from pricing to promotions to products, Sides said. This holiday season could mask weaknesses that might fester in months to come.

We are in a market that ebbs and flows with consumers, Sides said.",272,,28-Nov-18,"Move Over Amazon, Google's Got Some News Of Its Own",191,Indian Real Estate News,,"Move Over Amazon, Google's Got Some News Of Its Own

New Delhi, Nov. 28 -- Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, has just scooped up a $1 billion business park near its Mountain View headquarters.

Alphabet Inc.'s Google is the buyer of HCP Inc.'s Shoreline Technology Center campus in Mountain View, Calif., The Mercury News reported.

Healthcare real estate investment trust HCP had agreed to the $1 billion sale in the third quarter. The 51.8-acre property is located a few blocks from the Googleplex headquarters, according to the Nov. 26 report.

Bloomberg News also reported on the sale, citing confirmation on the acquisition from a Google spokeswoman.

HCP expected a gain of about $700 million from the sale.

According to the Silicon Valley Business Journal, which also reported on the sale, the 12-building, 795,663-square-foot office complex formerly served as the headquarters of LinkedIn. The sale price translates to roughly $1,259 per square foot, or more than $19.3 million per acre.

The internet giant is broadening aggressively in California, as well as over in the east coast in New York City.

The business park, which marks the biggest property purchase in 2018 in tech hub Silicon Valley, Calif., spans 51.8 acres and eclipses the size of Google's current headquarters, the Nov. 27 report noted, citing a report by The Mercury News.

Google in early November purchased a two-building office complex in San Jose, Calif., for $154.5 million, adding to the three industrial buildings it acquired in the city for $117.3 million in January. The company also picked up more office property in Sunnyvale, Calif., where its cloud computing unit is based, the news outlet added.

As part of its expansion in New York City, Google procured the 1.2 million-square-foot Chelsea Market mixed-use tower at 75 9th Ave. for $2.4 billion in early 2018, and is said to be close to purchasing or leasing 1.3 million square feet of office space currently being built at Oxford Properties Group's $2 billion St. John's terminal development in Manhattan, N.Y.C.",274,,27-Nov-18,Google Shells Out $1 Billion To Buy Near Its Silicon Valley Headquarters,245,Electronics Bazaar,,"Google Shells Out $1 Billion To Buy Near Its Silicon Valley Headquarters

Continuing its Silicon Valley property acquisition spree, Google paid $1 billion for a new office park near its headquarters in Mountain View, California.

According to the Mercury News, Google is already the primary tenant of the newly acquired Shoreline Technology Park in Mountain View. The acquisition gives Google a 51.8-acre site with 12 buildings.

The site is larger than the property that accommodates the company's Googleplex headquarters and also exceeds the size of the parcel across the street where Google is building an iconic ""dome"" campus that features canopies and tents.

A Silicon Valley Business Journal report said that HCP Inc. sold the property this month to Google.

In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Irvine-based company revealed that the gains on the sale would be around $700 million.

Earlier this month, Google agreed to pay an additional $110 million for 10.5 acres for a new campus in downtown San Jose, with the possibility of buying about 11 more acres.

Tech behemoth Google has made a fresh billion dollar deal for picking up a mega office complex in plush Silicon Valley, according to media reports. Google has spent a whopping $1 billion on a large office park near its headquarters in Mountain View, California, according to the Mercury News. With this purchase, Google has spent over $2.8 billion on properties in Mountain View, Sunnyvale and San Jose over the last two years alone. In this case, the world's second largest firm by market cap is buying property that it's already a tenant of. The company is the main tenant of the 12 buildings that comprise the 51.8-acre Shoreline Technology Park.

At a jaw-dropping $1 billion, Google is paying $19 million per acre for the 800,000 square-foot office campus, in what is being seen as one of the company's largest and most expensive North Bayshore acquisitions to date. Interestingly, Google's latest deal is the the second-largest property purchase in the United States this year, second only to the $2.4 billion which the company paid for Chelsea Market in Manhattan, according to a report in The Mercury News.

The report further added that the newly acquired site in Mountain View is larger than the the tech giant's Googleplex headquarters, just a few blocks to the west and also exceeds the size of the parcel across the street where Google is building an iconic ""dome"" campus that features canopies and tents.

Earlier this month, Google had agreed to pay an additional $110 million for 10.5 acres for a new campus in downtown San Jose, with the possibility of buying about 11 more acres.

The mega deal comes after Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said recently that the company favors ""owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities,"" according to CNBC.",276,Victoria Bell For Mailonline,27-Nov-18,Google Pays $1 Billion For A 51 Acre Site Minutes From Its Mountain View,464,Mailonline,Science; Version:2,"Google Pays $1 Billion For A 51 Acre Site Minutes From Its Mountain View

Google has paid $1 billion (еЈ784 million) for the former site of LinkedIn's Mountain View headquarters in the largest Bay Area real estate purchase by far this year.

The tech giant confirmed that they bought the 12-building Technology Park, totalling 795,663 square feet, but declined to comment any further.

The site, most of which Google already rents, is only a few minutes west of the company's Googleplex headquarters.

The purchase is the second largest property purchase in the United States this year, eclipsed only by the $2.4 billion (еЈ1,882,080 bn) the company paid for Chelsea Market in Manhattan.

The internet company has now spent at least $2.8 billion (еЈ2,195,088 bn) on properties in Mountain View, Sunnyvale and San Jose over the last two years.

Earlier this month, Google said it will also pay an additional $110 million (еЈ86 mn) for a new 10 care campus to house employees, pending a resident vote in December.

Google's parent Alphabet reported earnings of $33.7 billion (еЈ26.43 mn) in the third quarter, up 21 per cent. It had $13 billion (еЈ10 mn) in cash at the end of the quarter.

The FAANG companies - Facebook, Alphabet, Apple, Nasdaq and Google - all lost a collective $172 billion (еЈ134 bn) in value at the beginning of this month.

Google's parent company Alphabet's stock closed Monday at $1,020 a share, marking a 20% decline from its record high of $1,273.84 (еЈ991) a share in late July.

Like Facebook, Google has also come under scrutiny over privacy issues that resulted in a fine of $5.07 billion (еЈ3.94 bn) imposed by the European Union fine.

Chad Leiker, the vice president of Kidder Mathews, a commercial real estate firm said: 'This is an opportunity for Google to own more office space very close to their headquarters. That office space is becoming very rare in Mountain View.'

'This is in Google's core campus area, and they would certainly want to own it and control it rather than continue to lease it,' said Philip Mahoney, executive vice chairman with Newmark Knight Frank, a commercial real estate firm.

'The property begs for redevelopment with higher densities,' Mahoney said. 'But that would be a much longer discussion and process' in connection with Mountain View's development plan for the areas north of U.S. 101.

MOUNTAIN VIEW >> In a head-spinning mega-deal, Google has paid $1 billion for a huge Mountain View business park, the Bay Area's largest real estate purchase this year.

It is also the second-largest property purchase in the United States this year, eclipsed only by another Google acquisition, the $2.4 billion the company paid for Chelsea Market in Manhattan.

The newly acquired site in Mountain View, where Google has been the primary tenant, is larger than the property that accommodates the company's Googleplex headquarters a few blocks to the west and also exceeds the size of the parcel across the street where Google is building an iconic ""dome"" campus that features canopies and tents.

""Wow. What a deal,"" said Chad Leiker, a first vice president with Kidder Mathews, a commercial real estate firm. ""This is an opportunity for Google to own more office space very close to their headquarters. That office space is becoming very rare in Mountain View.""

Google's Mountain View purchase means that in the two years since the search giant began to collect properties in downtown San Jose for a proposed transit village, the company has spent at least $2.83 billion in property acquisitions in Mountain View, Sunnyvale, downtown San Jose and north San Jose alone.

Adding to the eye-popping numbers: Google's spending activity in those four markets reaches $3 billion when including the company's pending purchase in downtown San Jose of several government-owned parcels, along with the minimum value of a big set of surface parking lots that Google intends to buy from Trammell Crow, also downtown near its proposed transit village.

Buying Mountain View's Shoreline Technology Park gives Google a 51.8-acre site with 12 buildings. The big parcel, which is dominated by one and two-story buildings with ample surface parking, has addresses ranging from 2011 to 2091 Stierlin Court. Aside from Google, a survey of the site indicates that the only other tenant in the complex besides Google is Alexza Pharmaceuticals.

""This is in Google's core campus area, and they would certainly want to own it and control it rather than continue to lease it,"" said Philip Mahoney, executive vice chairman with Newmark Knight Frank, a commercial real estate firm.

""The property begs for redevelopment with higher densities,"" Mahoney said. ""But that would be a much longer discussion and process"" in connection with Mountain View's development plan for the areas north of U.S. 101.

Since its December 2016 purchase nearly two years ago of an old Pacific Bell building near the Diridon Station in San Jose, Google, directly or through affiliates, has spent at least $1.32 billion buying sites in Sunnyvale, $1 billion acquiring properties in Mountain View, $271.8 million in north San Jose and $234 million obtaining parcels in downtown San Jose.

Google's agreement to pay $109.9 million for government-owned properties in downtown San Jose, as well as the minimum value of $58.5 million for a nearby Trammel Crow-owned site, brings the company's buying surge in those four markets to $3 billion.

A Google representative confirmed the $1 billion purchase price for the office park but didn't comment beyond that.

Irvine-based HCP, a realty investment firm, sold Google the Mountain View property on Nov. 20, Santa County records show. HCP stated in a regulatory filing that it realized a $700 million gain from the sale. The property's assessed value in mid-2018 was $367.3 million.

""This latest deal in Mountain View could be a case, as they have done in other areas, of Google land-banking properties for higher-density uses later,"" Leiker said. ""They have bought a huge tranche of properties.""

The deal also appears to be the Bay Area's largest real estate transaction - by far - in 2018. Prior to Google's purchase, the highest price paid in Silicon Valley was a $284 million acquisition by developer Jay Paul of the Cityview Plaza office, retail and restaurant complex in downtown San Jose in July. That was topped by the October deal for San Francisco's iconic Ferry Building complex, a $291 million transaction.",278,States News Service,27-Nov-18,"After A Successful Pilot In San Jose, Stanford Looks To The Future Of",1105,States News Service,,"After A Successful Pilot In San Jose, Stanford Looks To The Future Of

The following information was released by Stanford University:

Stanford's alternative worksites in San Jose, San Francisco and Newark are designed to help provide relief from long commutes and high housing costs.

By Kate Chesley

The 13-month pilot was considered successful and has transitioned to ""proof of concept,"" meaning that its long-term feasibility is now being assessed. Meanwhile, two other alternative work locations have been opened in Newark and San Francisco. The objective of the sites, according to Noel Hirst, assistant vice president for business affairs finance and facilities, is to help provide relief from long commutes and high housing costs.

Hirst talks about the success of the San Jose pilot, the new worksites in Newark and San Francisco, and the future of Stanford's remote worksite program.

How many offsite work locations does the university now offer?

We have three. We offer 35 workspaces in San Jose on East Santa Clara Street. In July, we opened a site that has 22 workspaces in Newark on Balentine Drive. In October, we opened 28 spaces in San Francisco on California Street. Participants may book only one full day per week, which allows for the broadest participation. All three sites are at capacity, have waiting lists and require reservations in advance.

What is the biggest takeaway so far from Stanford's experiences with satellite worksites?

The largest takeaway is that people's lives are improved when they are able to reduce their commutes. That's true even if it's only for one day. We also learned that we needed to include monitors and keyboards at every desk at all locations. We had incorrectly assumed that people would just use laptops and cell phones.

We also found that employees in San Jose were using not just the university suite, but also the kitchen and dining space, phone rooms, conference rooms, hang-out areas and so on. We think that's a good indicator that people will find they like the workspaces that will be available in Stanford Redwood City when it opens next spring.

What is the objective in offering satellite worksites?

We've been prompted to rethink how we work by local affordability issues, the upcoming opening of the Stanford Redwood City campus and increased telecommuting. Plus, it's clear that new and evolving technology makes it easier for us to manage a virtual workplace while still being effective and productive. The long-range planning process elicited suggestions for how to confront these issues, and that's ultimately what led to the work alternative sites.

And there is good reason to pursue the ideas. National surveys show that, when it comes to attracting talent, workplace flexibility can tip the balance over pay. In other words, people will choose a job with a lower salary in favor of greater flexibility. And there are a lot of advantages to embracing a flexible work culture, including easing of long commutes, enhanced employee well-being, increased productivity, reduced turnover and transportation sustainability. But this approach takes practice. So our first site in San Jose allowed us to test how this might work, given Stanford's culture and the expectations of Stanford managers.

It's important to understand that alternative worksites aren't meant as a substitute or to replace telecommuting. Alternative worksites are ideal for employees who prefer a clear line of separation between work and home, the capacity to interact with others and the ability to take advantage of different workspace options.

What was the result of the San Jose pilot?

Some 481 employees took advantage of the San Jose site. The pilot ran from October 2017 to October 2018, consisting of six rotations of eight weeks. We worked with a number of groups, including the administrative deans, the Administrative Planning Executive Committee and the University Management Group on the rotations to accommodate the different approaches administrative units wanted to take.

There were 35 workstations and one conference room, and we could accommodate 100 employees. Employees signed up to work one or two days per week from the site; 98 percent of the participants said they experienced a shorter commute, and thus enjoyed more personal and family time and less stress; 73 percent said they were more productive at the remote site; and 79 percent said they were more engaged and energized.

Some of the people participating were able to reduce their commutes from an hour and a half to 30 minutes or less. About half of the participants were able to take advantage of public transportation. Many of the respondents to our survey told us, essentially, that they now had their lives back.

Also, 99 percent of the managers involved in the pilot were supportive of the university expanding alternative worksites to other locations, and 78 percent said they saw no loss of connectedness among the employees who participated.

We did find some challenges. Sometimes people signed up for the space, but then didn't use it. Some were called back to campus on days they had hoped to be at the worksite. Still, we felt the pilot was successful, and we are continuing that alternative location. As a result of a mid-pilot review of the San Jose experience, we were asked by the provost to expand into the East Bay and San Francisco.

What are the technological tools that employees can take advantage of when they need to interact with someone in a different location?

Zoom videoconferencing is probably the most obvious, and upgrades are being made throughout the main campus to provide more and better opportunities for videoconferencing. But there are other tools, like Slack, which is a messaging tool; Google Team Drive, which is for sharing files; and Jabber, through which you can use your computer or mobile device as a telephone.

But it's important to emphasize that everyone at Stanford needs to adopt these tools, not just the people who will work at Stanford Redwood City or our alternative worksites.

What does the future hold for additional alternative worksite locations?

Our hope is to develop a long-term strategy for alternative worksites using the San Jose results and an analysis of use of the Newark and San Francisco sites. We also are eager to offer our results to the Long-Range Planning Affordability Task Force and to learn from its work.

But in the meantime, we will be converting the Bambi Modular on the corner of Panama and Via Ortega into a 50-person touchdown space for Stanford Redwood City employees who need to be on the main campus periodically. The location will be operating just like existing worksites, with more booking variability in days and hours.",279,ЊЏ¦ЊП¬Ќђ»,27-Nov-18,Google Spends 1 Bln-usd On Property Purchase To Build Huge Business Park,208,Xinhua General News Service,International News,"Google Spends 1 Bln-usd On Property Purchase To Build Huge Business Park

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 26 (Xinhua) -- Top internet company Google has struck a 1 billion-U.S.-dollar deal for a big industry park near its headquarters in California, the largest property purchase in the Bay Area this year, The Mercury News reported Monday.

The newly acquired site is bigger than Google's existing Googleplex headquarters in Mountain View, northern California. The park will occupy a total of 0.21 square km in space with 12 buildings.

The deal is seen as another ambitious real estate expansion by the world's largest internet search company in Silicon Valley as it has bought more office space earlier this year in Sunnyvale, a city in Santa Clara County, California.

The local newspaper said Google's mega-acquisition is the second largest property purchase in the United States this year. The company has bought a property in Manhattan, New York for 2.4 billion dollars.

Earlier this month, Google agreed to buy more than 40,467 square meters from San Jose city for 110 million dollars for its expansion.

Apart from the mega property acquisition, Google leased about 27,871 square meters of room for more than 1,500 of its employees in downtown San Francisco in early November, making it the third largest tech tenant in the city.

Google has just made the region's biggest real estate buy of the year on a Mountain View office for $1 billion, showing that the tech titan's appetite to own more space in space-constrained Silicon Valley isn't slowing.

Mountain View-based Google has purchased the Britannia Shoreline Technology Park, a 12-building, 795,663-square-foot office complex that was once home to LinkedIn's headquarters. LinkedIn offered up its onetime headquarters to Google for lease as part of a major 2016 land-swap agreement between the companies.

The deal for the nearly 52-acre campus at 2011-2091 Stierlin Court works out to nearly $1,259 per square foot, or more than $19.3 million per acre. Though the price per square foot or acre aren't bell-ringers for pricey Silicon Valley, overall the transaction is by far the largest in the region this year. The Mercury News first reported the closure, The Registry reported last month that the campus was slated to be sold.

HCP Inc. sold the property this month to Google after picking it up before the Great Recession of 2008 hit the region. The company traditionally focuses on the healthcare sectors, including life science, medical office and senior housing, according to its website and portfolio.

Public property records don't show how how much Irvine-based HCP paid for the property, but in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission the company revealed that the gains on the sale would be around $700 million. Those funds will go toward repaying debt and then redeploying a portion of those funds toward new acquisitions and development and redevelopment projects, according to public records.

""This transaction highlights our ability to unlock meaningful shareholder value and generate attractively-priced capital which we will use to delever and further strengthen our balance sheet as well as fund future accretive growth,"" Peter Scott, executive vice president and chief financial officer of HCP said in a statement.

The deal with Alphabet Inc.-owned Google comes after two other big real estate deals by the tech giant in recent weeks in other South Bay cities, showing the search engine and advertising company has its eye on more than just its hometown.

Earlier this month, the city of San Jose announced that Google had agreed to pay $109.87 million on about 10.5 acres of publicly owned land near the city's downtown, where the company wants to build a 6 million- to 8 million-square-foot mixed-use campus. That deal is set to see a final vote by the San Jose City council next month.

Meanwhile Google also spent $160.3 million for a four-building complex known as Chesapeake Commons at 1310-1327 Chesapeake Terrace in Sunnyvale's Moffett Park, where the company had already spent more than a billion dollars picking up real estate and land.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the deal, but this story will be updated if or when the company does.

HIGHLIGHT:еКMichael Covarrubias, CEO of developer TMG Partners, is a key player on both the finance and building sides of the development coin and recently gave his assessment of the downtown districts of Oakland and San Jose.

Michael Covarrubias is a key player on both the finance and building sides of the development coin. He spent 17 years with Union Bank, including a stint as a decision maker in the banks construction lending unit. Since 1988, Covarrubias has been with development stalwart TMG Partners and is TMGs chairman and chief executive officer.

If theres a big commercial real estate market in the Bay Area, San Francisco-based TMG is in it. This news organization recently talked with Covarrubias aboutеК the nine-county regions development scene, and in particular, the picture in downtown San Jose and downtown Oakland.

Q How hot is the current commercial real estate market in the Bay Area?

A No one likes to say its different this time. But the corollary is that its always different. This market is different from the dot-com era.

Q In what ways is it different? How does the upswing compare with the dot-com period? Is it the FAANGs, the Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google tech companies?

AеКThe magnitude and breadth of the FAANGs and the almost-FAANGs has never been seen before in the Bay Area. They are highly capitalized. They are very aggressive in their growth efforts. Their appetite to increase their employees is something unlike we have ever seen.

Q How do you assess the downtown sectors of the Bay Areas three largest cities?

A San Francisco has essentially been out of large blocks of space for about three years. Oakland is the beneficiary of that, as is downtown San Jose.

Q How long have you been active outside of the downtown San Francisco market?

A We went to San Jose and Oakland three years ago. We entered both those markets even though that was 2015, when there were worries about how long the economic recovery would last. We thought there were several more years of economic expansion.

Q What are your major efforts in downtown Oakland?

A We bought three major assets in Oakland and earlier this year we sold 1330 Broadway downtown. We will still be in Oakland after this deal. We are bringing two other assets to the market this year.

Q What are your plans in downtown San Jose?

A In San Jose, we have our Platform 16 office project, consisting of 1 million square feet of offices, a fully entitled project. We are now starting to think about how to activate that development. We are having conversations with tenants and capital partners.

Q Whats the development expense for Platform 16?

A It will cost $800 million to $900 million to build that campus. That is a big project.

Q What are the pluses and minuses of downtown Oakland?

A The bones of Oakland have always been great. Transportation, freeway and BART access, the waterfront, proximity to San Francisco, a workforce that draws from the east, the north and the south. What Oakland lacked was the momentum to create a 24-hour city. They tried office buildings, but those didnt work. They tried retail and that didnt work.

Q Have things begun to change for the better in downtown Oakland?

AеК You have the Uptown district, the artists, the theaters, the non-profits, great restaurants and safety is increasing. Under Mayor (Libby) Schaaf, crime has gone down dramatically. And then you add the bonus round. San Franciscos downtown is full.

Q What are the pluses and minuses of downtown San Jose?

A Ive had a lot of experience with San Jose. San Jose was on its way to being a very complete place when the 2008 economic crash happened. Everything that was being planned went up in smoke. A lot of projects were foreclosed or abandoned.

Q How are things improved now in downtown San Jose?

A Now you have the transit hub at Diridon Station. That station is the most multi-modal transit hub in the entire Bay Area. It has Caltrain, Amtrak, light rail, the ACE Train, and BART is coming to that station. Companies want to be on the Caltrain line, next to BART, and in an urban environment. If we get high-speed rail from the Central Valley and Los Angeles, that will all add to Diridon Station.

Q How much of a difference is all this activity at the train station, Googles interest in the area, going to make for downtown San Jose?

A San Jose is finally going to have its day. If it all comes to pass, Google will be the anchor of a complete revitalization of the downtown. Google creates the need for more housing, the need for more retail, more restaurants. All of it will be focused on transit. BART will open up so much for so many corridors.

Q Are big infill developments such as your proposed Platform 16 office campus in downtown San Jose the future in the Bay Area?

A Fixing transportation is a slow process. You cant build a new bridge everywhere, or double-deck all the freeways. But you can put peoples jobs near where they live. That is done through BART or Caltrain. The traffic is beyond horrible, and the goal is less traffic on the freeway. That is why infill development is an answer. You are going to have growth, you have to find creative ways to accommodate the growth. You cant put a lid on boiling water and expect it to stop. Make buildings bigger and more efficient, put them in places where people can take BART, Caltrain, or light rail.

Working from home could become even more rewarding.

Tulsa is aiming to attract people by offering those who work remotely and entrepreneurs $10,000 to move there. If they agree to stay for at least one year, the workers will receive cash that includes rent subsidies and stipends.

The initiative in Tulsa is the latest effort to convince people to move to smaller cities. The programs dangle thousands of dollars in perks and incentives, hoping to draw in workers who might otherwise settle in major metropolitan areas. Since the financial crisis, the countrys most prosperous cities have become more economically dominant. According to a Brookings Institution report on economic inequality, the rise of information technology has rewarded areas that are already densely developed.

Dubbed Tulsa Remote, the program is sponsored by the George Kaiser Family Foundation, whose website for the initiative has received more than 6,000 applications since it went live earlier this month, according to Ken Levit, the executive director of GKFF.

Levit said Tulsa Remote is part of a broader strategy of making the community more vibrant and inclusive and boosting its economic development by energizing and diversifying its businesses. I am surprised and elated by the response, by the enormous amount of momentum out of the box, he said.

According to Labor Department statistics, the Tulsa metro area has an unemployment rate of 3 percent, ranking 110th out of all areas, but still below the national rate of 3.7 percent.

To qualify for Tulsa Remote, applicants must be at least 18 years old and be employed with a company that allows them to work remotely. Entrepreneurs who do not reside in Tulsa County can also apply. The total package of $10,000 spread out over a year covers $2,500 for moving expenses, monthly payments of $500 to help cover rent, and $1,500 after living in Tulsa for one year, according to Levit. There are other benefits that make the offer even richer, which include about $300 per month in additional rental assistance, Levit said. Applicants will go through a video interview and visit the city before they are made an offer.

The remote employees and entrepreneurs who move to Tulsa will also receive free coworking space to do business, offered by 36 Degrees North, in downtown Tulsa, according to Levit.

Several other cities offer major incentives to people willing to relocate, according to CNBC. Students who have graduated in the last 10 years with a degree in a STEAM program (science, technology, engineering, art, or math) can get up to $15,000 from the Community Foundation of St. Clair to pay off their student loans, if they move to St. Clair, Michigan, where the joblessness rate is 3.9 percent. The Hamilton Community Foundation in Hamilton, Ohio, offers recent college graduates up to $5,000 to relocate, if they have already secured a job there. The area has an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent. And in New Haven, Connecticut, people can get $10,000 in interest-free loans on their first home. The unemployment rate there is 3.9 percent. To encourage residents to plant even deeper roots, families could be eligible for $40,000 for in-state college tuition, if their children graduate from public school in New Haven.

Officials in San Jose have laid out a three-part plan of attack to reap community benefits and keep housing costs low if Google gets its way in planting a massive new campus in the city's downtown.

The three-pronged approach includes creating a new ""financing district"" to generate funds for infrastructure improvement planning and working out a list of community benefits Google would offer if the 8 million-square-foot campus the tech titan is dreaming up comes to fruition.

But perhaps the boldest of the city's goals is an effort to codify into law that 25 percent of all new housing in the neighborhoods around the campus would be considered affordable and come with ""long-term rent restrictions.""

""A 25% affordable housing requirement is a major step in the right direction toward making sure no one from our community is left out,"" Councilmember Sylvia Arenas said in a statement this week. ""San Jose families need good-paying jobs and housing that is affordable.""

The announcement comes days after San Jose and Google came to an agreement over how much the Mountain View-based tech giant would pay for a spate of publicly owned land around San Jose's Diridon Station, where the company wants to build a campus for up to 20,000 Google employees.

San Jose's City Council members will vote Dec. 4 on whether to accept nearly $110 million in exchange about 10.5 acres of land near the city's downtown.

If approved, the city and Google would sit down to hammer out more details of Google's contributions to infrastructure, housing affordability, parks and other benefits.

In full, Mayor Sam Liccardo, Vice Mayor Magdalena Carrasco, Councilmembers Arenas and Dev Davis have committed to working on the following three goals, city documents show:

еб    Negotiations with Google over community benefits in addition to the fees, taxes and public improvements that Google has today committed to pay. еб    Form a downtown financing district using commercial impact fees or a privately funded annual assessment for affordable housing, transit and other public improvements. еб    Make mandatory that 25 percent of the aggregate housing built in the neighborhoods around Diridon Station be affordable, with long-term rent restrictions in place, using affordable housing funding from multiple sources.

The 25 percent affordability goal would be a big hike from the current inclusionary housing requirement set by the city, which mandates at least 15 percent of all homes in a given residential project be affordable.

City officials have been careful not to call the recently announced 25 percent affordable housing goal ""inclusionary,"" however. Instead, the city uses the word ""aggregate,"" which could imply that not all projects in the area will be required to set aside that many affordable units, if offset by other developments.

That could be good news to developers, who have been pushing back on rising city fees around the Bay Area as construction costs also rise dramatically, making housing projects in some areas difficult to pencil. Earlier this year, the Silicon Valley Business Journal explored a recent city study that shows that new housing projects are largely infeasible financially in several parts of San Jose, based on land and construction costs paired with potential rental income. (Read more about that here.)

City officials say they aim to get the funding to fulfill the 25 percent affordability goal from multiple affordable housing sources, according to an announcement this week, but didn't name any sources specifically.

Next week, Liccardo and other councilmembers will formally request the Council prioritize working out the details of the three goals soon after the Dec. 4 vote on whether to sell publicly owned land to Google, which is a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.

""We cannot deny that our community is rapidly changing, and the investment of Google will have a real and direct impact,"" Carrasco said in a statement this week. ""We will continue the work on the preservation of the unique character of San JosМ© neighborhoods, including East San JosМ©, by mitigating displacement and gentrification while guaranteeing career opportunities for our youth and opportunities for upward mobility.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe San Jose City Council will push Google to offer a range of community benefits.

With Google and San Jose agreeing on a price for city-owned land and planning for a massive downtown campus near Diridon Station about to begin in earnest, the city now can lay out what it hopes to reap from the tech giants foray benefits thatеКcould affect the trajectory of the region for years to come.

In that vein, Mayor Sam Liccardo and several of his City Council colleagues Vice Mayor Magdalena Carrasco, Sylvia Arenas and Dev Davis  said they plan to push for a new affordable housing requirement, as well as a fee on commercial development to pay for some of that housing, along with improvements to public transportation and other things.

We cannot deny that our community is rapidly changing, and the investment of Google will have a real and direct impact, Carrasco said in a statement. We will continue the work on the preservation of the unique character of San Jose neighborhoods, including East San Jose, by mitigating displacement and gentrification while guaranteeing career opportunities for our youth and opportunities for upward mobility.

The City Council is expected to approve the sale of city-owned land to Google on Dec. 4. The four council members say they will push to require that 25 percent of the overall housing built in neighborhoods around Diridon Station be affordable, and they want to see long-term rent restrictions put into place. Ultimately, Google wants to build 6 million to 8 million square feet of office and retail space  and bring in some 20,000 jobs  on about 50 acres just west of Highway 87 and the core of downtown.

Were glad the mayor and City Council are now finally realizing the need to address the massive impacts Google will have on the citys housing crisis and its effect on residents through community benefits, but with so few details its hard to tell whether this will be enough, said Maria Noel Fernandez, the campaign director for Silicon Valley Rising, an organization that has raised concerns about the project. For 18 months, weve said the issue of displacement was the biggest еКcommunity concern in the Google deal and proposed community benefits, increased inclusionary housing requirements, impact fees andеКa number of other measures to fix this. We need to know whether Google is really committed to addressing their full impacts on the community through affordable housing, protections from displacement and commitments to family supporting jobs for local residents.

Many of the specifics still need to be worked out, and the proposals will have to work their way through the whole council. Its not clear yet, for example, exactly how affordable the housing would be, but, the mayor said during a phone interview the idea would be to have some housing developments be entirely affordable, which would allow other projects to be flexible.

If Liccardo and his allies can drum up enough support, the 25 percent requirement would mark a significant increase from the 15 percent of homes developers typically are asked to set aside as affordable.

The council members are also pushing for the formation of a district downtown, including the area around Diridon, where the city could impose whats known as a commercial impact fee or something similar so commercial developers would help pay for affordable housing and other community benefits such as better bikeways and sidewalks.

Though other cities in the region have such fees, San Jose has resisted, concerned that they could slow the flow of development and exacerbate an already bad jobs-housing imbalance in the region.

Anything to discourage business from coming here will worsen the economic situation for our city and force us to ask for more new taxes, said Councilman Johnny Khamis, one of the councils more conservative members.

Liccardo said he thinks the area still would be be too much of a draw to deter businesses, however.

I certainly retain those concerns in several parts of the city where we have difficulty seeing much job growth, the mayor said, but in the downtown, with all the investment we've madetheres a very different story.

The consideration of such a fee signals an attempt to please critics of the project, particularly labor groups that have argued the new development will send already sky-high housing costs soaring.

And some groups have responded to the outreach.

Enrique Arguello, the business manager for Laborers International Local 270, said in a statement the group supports the public-private partnership between Google and the city provided both agree to an open dialogue with the community.

For Scott Knies, head of the San Jose Downtown Association, the negotiations with Google are an opportunity for San Jose to think broadly and creatively about how the area around Diridon should look. And while some developers arent going to like the idea of paying a fee to do business in the area, theres got to be a value capture, Knies said.

If, for instance, the city eases height restrictions in the area and allows builders to put up taller buildings, that will create more space for businesses and could free up ground level area for parks or walkways or public art for both workers and local residents. But those will need to be funded.

As with many major developments, theres a bit of quid pro quo going on, Knies said.

But, he and others say, where Apple built an enclosed office  the spaceship  in suburban Cupertino that sucks in cars and workers each morning and spits them out each evening, Google is interested in helping create an open, mixed-use neighborhood that is an integral part of the city.

Google and the city have agreed to negotiate so-called community benefits before the City Council makes decisions on a range of issues, from land use designations to zoning, that will affect the project. Right now, for instance, the area around Diridon that Google wants to develop is zoned for industrial uses such as warehouses. The development review process is expected to start in 2019 and last at least a couple of years.

This is the first company thats ever honestly worked with us on issues like transportation and housing, Khamis said. Im excited about it.

Liccardo said he hopes that as the Google development moves forward, residents will view tech companies not as saviors or supplicants, but as partners with San Jose.

Often, such as with the news that Amazon will locate its new headquarters in New York and northern Virginia, large tech companies are viewed as beneficiaries of public largesse, Liccardo said. Google presents a very different narrative and San Jose is establishing a different relationship with tech.",287,,20-Nov-18,Dealbook Briefing: Nissan's Chairman Faces Criminal Charges Over Secret,1953,The New York Times,Section ; Column 0; Business/financial Desk,"Dealbook Briefing: Nissan's Chairman Faces Criminal Charges Over Secret

Good Monday. Here's an exclusive sneak peek: A new documentary on the business empire of LeBron James (he's a DealBook reader!) and the team he built will air this week on ESPN+. Here's a clip from ''More Than An Athlete.'' More on the new documentary below. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)

Carlos Ghosn faces criminal investigation

Nissan announced this morning that it planned to remove Mr. Ghosn as its chairman, saying an internal investigation had found that for years he underreported his salary by millions of dollars and committed other acts of ''misconduct.''

Nissan said it was working with the Japanese authorities. According to news reports, prosecutors are preparing to arrest Mr. Ghosn.

The developments could bring about a swift fall for Mr. Ghosn, who made his name by rescuing Nissan from dire financial straits almost two decades ago and forging partnerships with Renault and Mitsubishi to create an international car giant.

Shares in Nissan and Renault, where Mr. Ghosn is chairman and C.E.O., are down by about 10 percent in European trading.

The U.S. and China aren't budging in their trade fight

Last week, it looked like trade tensions might finally ease between Beijing and Washington. But Vice President Mike Pence and President Xi Jinping of China both defended the practices of their countries on Saturday at an Asia-Pacific trade meeting in Papua New Guinea. And then, Damien Cave of the NYT writes, they ''dug in and refused to compromise.''

The WSJ reports that midlevel Chinese officials sought to block the publishing of a statement from the meeting because they believed a phrase -- ''We agreed to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices'' -- unfairly singled out their country's activities. Ultimately, nothing was published.

The NYT notes that failure to make any progress during the talks left world leaders increasingly exasperated. ''The entire world is worried,'' said Prime Minister Peter O'Neill of Papua New Guinea, who led the talks.

The event suggests that no truce between China and the U.S. is imminent. And it sets up a high-stakes showdown at the Group of 20 conference in Argentina this month, which Mr. Xi and President Trump are expected to attend.

Mark Zuckerberg tried to rally his employees

In an hourlong videoconference question-and-answer session with employees on Friday afternoon, Facebook's C.E.O. fiercely defended his company and pushed back against an investigation from the NYT. He said claims that he and Sheryl Sandberg had sought to conceal warning signs of looming crises were wrong.

(Some parts of the NYT's report have been confirmed. Facebook's former chief security officer wrote in the WaPo: ''Yup, Sheryl Sandberg yelled at me.'' She apparently later apologized.)

The WSJ reports that Mr. Zuckerberg considers the social network ''at war'' as a result of its recent tussles with lawmakers, investors and users, and that he has been trying to act more decisively as a leader.

A big part of that now appears focused on bolstering employee morale, which reports have suggested is falling. During his Q. and A., Mr. Zuckerberg said that leaks to reporters were often caused by ''issues with morale.'' Staff members were encouraged to keep working on the company's problems despite media scrutiny.

More Facebook news: The company's scandals have strained the relationship between Democrats and Silicon Valley. And here's a look at some of the tactics used by Definers, the P.R. agency that Facebook fired last week.

Theresa May hopes business support can save her Brexit deal

The British prime minister still faces daunting odds: Getting her proposal for Britain's departure from the E.U. through Parliament will be tough. She's now betting that British companies will convince skeptical lawmakers to back a deal they dislike.

Mrs. May is scheduled to meet with the Confederation of British Industry, a trade group, today. She hopes to collect support from businesses who think that an imperfect deal at least offers some certainty compared to a no-deal Brexit. She will also head to Brussels again this week to continue talks with E.U. officials.

But lawmakers from her Conservative Party who favor a cleaner break from the E.U. remain dissatisfied, and they may yet move to oust her. They almost certainly won't be pleased by E.U. negotiators floating the idea of extending Britain's transition out of the bloc until 2022.

Why Michael Bloomberg is giving $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins

The businessman said yesterday that he would give $1.8 billion to his alma mater to make the school ''forever need-blind.'' It's believed to be the single biggest private donation to higher education in modern times.

The donation is meant to let Johns Hopkins offer more financial aid to students in the form of scholarship grants instead of loans. ''Our dedicated financial aid endowment was simply too small,'' the school's president, Ronald Daniels, told the WaPo. Now, he added, ''We will be fully and permanently need-blind in our admissions.''

In an NYT Op-Ed, Mr. Bloomberg explained his rationale:

A recent analysis by The Times found that at dozens of America's elite colleges, more students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire bottom 60 percent of that scale -- even though many of those lower-income students have the qualifications to get in.

And until recently, by some estimates, half of all high-achieving low- and middle-income students have not even been applying to top colleges -- largely because they believe they can't afford it, doubt they'll be accepted, or aren't even aware of their options.

Tim Cook says the free market isn't helping protect privacy

In an interview with Axios, Apple's C.E.O. argued that without sufficient regulation of the technology industry, some tech companies appear to have failed to protect consumers:

''Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of regulation. I'm a big believer in the free market. But we have to admit when the free market is not working. And it hasn't worked here. I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation. I think the Congress and the administration at some point will pass something.''

The comment is another effort by Mr. Cook to distance Apple, which focuses on selling hardware, from companies like Facebook and Google that make money from selling ads based on user data.

He also argued that tech companies should embrace regulation. ''This is not a matter of privacy versus profits, or privacy versus technical innovation,'' he said. ''That's a false choice.''

Beijing didn't like the West's playbook. So it wrote its own.

In the years after Mao's death, China had to recover from decades of political and economic turmoil. More than three-quarters of the population lived in extreme poverty.

Today, China leads the world in its number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and -- by some counts -- billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent of the population. An isolated, impoverished country has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.

To explain that drastic shift, the NYT has put together a series of in-depth articles that delve into China's meteoric rise. The series will run this week and next, online, as well as in an extra Friday edition of DealBook and in a special section in Sunday's newspaper.

Take a sneak peek at ESPN's new series on LeBron's business empire

The new eight-part documentary is a showcase for the basketball star and media-mogul entrepreneur. It tells the story of how he and three of his closest friends -- Maverick Carter, Rich Paul and Randy Mims -- created a kingdom that now includes a production company and talent agency. (The series will also be a test for ESPN's new streaming service, ESPN+, which will begin airing the episodes tomorrow.)

''I've never really told this story. Even though it's on ESPN and I play basketball, this is a business story and not a sports story,'' Mr. James said in a statement to DealBook. ''My guys and I have been scrapping, building and fighting for 16 years to create an entirely new model. I hope this documentary connects with every young, aspiring entrepreneur trying to change the game and refuse to accept the old way doing of things.''

Google has dominated headlines for the past 17 months as it hammers out the details of a massive planned new corporate campus in San Jose, but the company has also been quietly at work on a large project in its hometown.

Charleston East, nestled in Mountain View's North Bayshore neighborhood, is Alphabet Inc.-owned Google's first built-from-scratch corporate campus.

The two-story, 595,000-square-foot canopied project was unanimously approved by the Mountain View City Council in March 2017 and broke ground a few months later in June - mere days ahead of the company's announcement that it was also planning a megacampus in the heart of the Bay Area's largest city nearly 15 miles south.

But we at the Silicon Valley Business Journal haven't forgotten about the 18.6-acre Charleston East project in that time, and this month we got our hands on an exclusive video that shows the company's progress on the futuristic building, above.

Take a look at the slideshow below to see what the finished product will look like.

The new office project, which comes with a multitiered ""canopy"" that drapes over the entire two-story building, is beginning to take shape. The roofline reads more like a tent being propped up by tall beams throughout the building, rather than a dome, which is the building concept the tech giant originally pitched to the city in 2015.

Google's new campus is aiming for ultra-green features, including a roof that will capture water for reuse and hold solar panels that will create about four megawatts of power, Michelle Kaufmann, an architect working for Google, told the City Council last year.

""To put that into context, all of the [solar] panels that are on top of Googleplex, as well as the parking lots, totals 1.6 megawatts,"" she said. ""So this is pretty big.""

When complete, likely near the end of 2019 or beginning of 2020, the campus will come with walking trails, a public park and plaza and ground-floor retail. Bjarke Ingels Group and London-based Heatherwick Studio designed the project.

Google paid $215.2 million to LinkedIn in 2016 in a blockbuster Silicon Valley land swap that allows the two tech giants to each move forward with their respective development plans. That deal gave Google control over critical puzzle pieces in North Bayshore, providing a path forward for the search giant's futuristic vision there.

Since that historic land swap, the city of Mountain View has approved a new zoning and development plan - known as the North Bayshore Precise Plan - for the area that prioritizes housing, aiming to bring nearly 10,000 new homes to the area.

Mountain View elected officials last month took the first step toward bringing that plan to fruition when the city council approved its first new housing project in the area, proposed by prolific South Bay developer The Sobrato Organization. That development is slated to bring more than 600 new residential units to the area and about 231,000 square feet of new office space.

The city of San Jose is on the verge of potentially selling a swath of prime real estate to search giant Google for a new corporate campus, but recently released documents on the negotiations leave unanswered questions about the deal.

Documents published Friday show Mountain View-based Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., is prepared to spend $109.87 million on about 10.5 acres of publicly-owned land near the city's downtown, where it wants to build a 6 million-square-foot to 8 million-square foot mixed-use campus - assuming the deal is approved by the City Council next month.

But questions still remain, including some around how - or if - Google will work out a sale of several more city-owned land parcels, like the three parking lots currently used for the San Jose Sharks totaling nearly 10.8 acres known as Lots A, B and C in city documents.

The Silicon Valley Business Journal spoke with San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo last week, and asked him to reflect on the Google negotiations so far, clarify details of what's left to hammer out with the company, and elaborate on why he thinks Google is the best buyer and tenant for a spate of publicly owned land in the core of the Bay Area's largest city.

What follows is a slightly abridged version of that interview, edited for length and clarity.

Do you anticipate Google, the city and the Sharks will be able to come up with an agreement for the remaining parking lots to be sold?

We're continuing to work through the issues. We've identified parcels where we believe we can add parking capacity and implementing those concepts will help clear the way for a transaction.

So, there will be some shuffling first?

There's a lot of shuffle going on, because it is obviously those A,B,C sites, but also Lot D, which is across the street that the city owns, which is going to be a future construction site for BART in just a couple years ideally. So all of those issues are wrapped up in this as well, along with the fact that with lots A, B and C, you've got very polluted soil.

All the parties agreed that the best approach was to provide something of an option, and I say 'something of an option' because it's not a true option. It's sort of a right to purchase if a lot of things happen.

If all of that comes together for the parking lots, what will that sale process look like?

We've worked out the price (at $111.475 million, according to public records)... but there will be offsets. For example, ... the soil is badly polluted, it needs to be remediated. Typically, sellers deliver a clean site, in this case if we are delivering the site, it would not be cleaned.

еб    See also: Google is gearing up to buy prime San Jose land for a new tech campus. What now?

You were optimistic near the beginning of the year that it wouldn't take very long to agree on a dollar amount for the city-owned parcels. How do you feel these negotiations went and why did they stretch out so long?

It was less about price and more about all of the challenges that are associated with parcels with historic uses that have caused ongoing industrial contamination and existing uses - whether it's parking or fire training - that needed to be relocated. An awful lot of work has been around, ""How can we ensure that all of these parts move together in a sequence that enables all of the stakeholders to declare success?""

It's a small amount of turf and a lot of activity we're talking about building. Within spitting distance, you've got the first high speed rail station of any major city in the country, you've got a BART station, potentially 8 million square feet of R&D and office, along with retail and restaurants and housing, ... parking garages and a train station that will serve as potentially the busiest multimodal station in the western United States in a decade or so.

Why do you feel this is the best use for these publicly owned parcels?

Well, it's no secret that I was an early and avid advocate of a baseball stadium. The good news is that Google's going to pay a whole lot more tax revenues and create far more sustainable activity in our downtown than a ballpark could.

Let me back up, though. Seven years ago, with the input of more than 5,000 residents, the community and the council created a blueprint for development in the city called the General Plan, and that plan called for the revitalization of the downtown by adding 48,500 jobs to our diminutive downtown. That is a massive expansion that was contemplated by a community that desperately wanted to see a more vibrant center befitting the city of our size.

Who knows how many jobs this will create, but let me just say Google likely will not add even half as much as the community contemplated. But this gives us a pretty good head start in achieving our longstanding ambitions.

So, this land is best used for a mixed-use corporate campus because it helps San Jose get jobs?

Well, yeah. Great cities have great downtowns, which are job centers and as you know, San Jose has traditionally been the bedroom community for the rest of the Valley.

There are lots of other reasons why as well... For example, if you're going to invest several billion dollars in transit systems that all converge in one place, we know that employment will drive far more ridership than any other use. This is a way for us to maximize our taxpayer dollars invested in our transit infrastructure there.

One of the biggest community concerns is affordability and whether people will get pushed out of their homes. What would you say to people who are scared?

The fear is both real and reasonable because it's already happening, and I think it's important for everyone to recognize that the displacement in our city is not happening because Google is here. It's happening because really large companies are perched just outside of our borders and driving up costs within San Jose and everywhere else.

The fact that Google would move inside San Jose ... does not create a housing crisis. What creates the housing crisis is a valley that's adding jobs at six times the rate it's adding housing. That requires all of us - San Jose and all the surrounding communities - to redouble our efforts to build housing.

The other really important point here is people seem to believe this campus will be built next year and then 20,000 Googlers will descend from the sky. First of all, an awful lot of Google employees already live in San Jose and they're chained to their steering wheels a couple of hours a day in traffic on [highways] 85 and 101. We would all be much happier if they were commuting a shorter distance than a longer one.

It's not the case that we're importing all these folks from faraway lands when about 70 percent of Google's employment base in the Bay Area live in a location from Mountain View and south. An awful lot of the desks at the new Google campus will be filled by current San Jose residents.

The last thing I'd say is it's going to be a long time before this campus gets built out. Let's say 20,000 jobs are added - we don't know exactly [how many jobs], but that's just a guess at this point -еКit's going to take at least a decade, and if you look at statistically what that means for a city the size of San Jose, that's a minuscule annual increase in our employment. Adding 2,000 jobs a year is helpful, but hardly disruptive.

Is there anything else that you wanted to add that we haven't talked about?

Yes, we are in the wake of Amazon's very well-publicized announcements [about HQ2], and what a stark contrast the relationship between Google and San Jose provides to the subsidies shopping that has been the Amazon HQ2 quest. Two communities have provided more than $2 billion in tax breaks and subsidies to a company comparable in size to Google while Google is paying full freight, and then some, for the land, taxes and fees.

When I started talking to Google executives about this move, before we even negotiated it - this would've been back probably in late 2016 or early 2017 - I made it clear that we weren't going to offer any breaks or any subsidies. And to Google's credit, they never asked for any. If we consider the tale of three cities here, I'd like to believe ours provides a model for a more appropriate relationship between tech and local communities.

Im a proud resident of San Jose and Im excited for the opportunity for a vibrant downtown with the arrival ofеКGoogleеКto the Diridon Station area.

Rather than leaving our region,еКGoogleеКhas proposed growing locally, bringing 15,000 to 20,000 new jobs to downtown San Jose over the next decade.еКThis opportunityеКwould connect those who live or work there to public transit, including Caltrain, Amtrak, light rail, and - by 2026 - BART. The Diridon Station areaеКwould be a destination for all, including homes, shops, restaurants, offices and open spaces - all open to the public.

There are numerous reasons that the vast majority of San Jose residents support the opportunity ofеКGoogle in our downtown:

еб Job Creation:еКIt will be an important source of jobs for San Jose, supporting more than 1,000 full-time, family supporting construction jobs and between 15,000 and 20,000 permanent new jobs.

еб Strong Economy: GoogleеКat Diridon will have enormous economic benefits for San Jose residents.еКExperts estimate that it will generate millions of dollars annually in new tax revenueеКfor theеКcity,еКcounty, and local school districts. This revenue will support local services like K-12 education, public safety, road repairs, public transit, parks, and our County Hospital.

еб Open Space:еКIt will include new parkland and open space that will be open and available toеКthe public.еКIt willеКalsoеКutilize the space between buildings to create parks, plazas, and Paseos for members of the community to gather.

еб Affordable Housing:еКThe most critical challenge facing San Jose is a lack of affordable housing. Young people who grow up here have to move away to find an affordable place to live; seniors who want to downsize have to do the same. GoogleеКat Diridon will generate revenue that directly supports building more affordable housing and aеКsignificantеКamount of new homes for the city.

еб Proximity to Transit Options:еКOne of the biggest problems facing San Jose is our extreme traffic congestion. GoogleеКat Diridon would connect the thousands of people who live and work there to multiple transit lines at the Diridon Station ? Caltrain, light rail, the Altamont Commuter Express, Amtrak, buses andеКexpress buses, and - by 2026 - the BART extension. Its designed to minimize traffic impacts, prevent pollution,еКand improveеКour quality of life.

еб Inclusive Planning:еКMore thanеК5,000 San Jose residents worked together since 2011 to develop a future plan for downtown development. After dozens of hearings and workshops, these citizens determined that at least 45,000 well-paying jobs are needed to create a vibrant downtown. GoogleеКat Diridon is an important step toward meeting thisеКcommunity goal.

еб Current Neighbors:еКSeveral thousand currentеКGoogleеКemployees already live in San Jose. ThisеКopportunity will shorten their commutes, and as a result ease traffic congestion for all of us on local roads and freeways.

еб Revitalizing Downtown: GoogleеКat Diridon will connect business and shopping districts in downtown and Cahill Park, and create a Los Gatos Creek bike and pedestrian trail, revitalizing and connecting downtown San Jose, and making it a destination for everyone to live, work and play.

Google and the city of San Jose have wrapped up 17 months of negotiations over a spate of publicly-owned land where the tech titan is aiming to build its next massive mixed-use campus.

The end of the negotiations marks a major milestone in a multifaceted process as Google works toward building a transit-oriented campus for as many as 20,000 workers in the city core.

Documents released Friday show that during the months of negotiations, the city and company hashed out the tentative $109.87 million sale of about 10.5 acres of publicly-owned land, along with a framework of broad goals for any development that Alphabet Inc.-owned Google may build in the space around the city's busy and growing Diridon transit station.

The land sale, which still needs to be approved by the San Jose City Council next month to be finalized, works out to $237.50 per square foot. The land included in the deal is both city-owned properties and about 6.5 acres of land owned by the Successor Agency to the Redevelopment Agency (SARA).

The agreement pushes the city forward in developing the area around the Diridon Station transit hub and extending the downtown core westward, Kim Walesh, San Jose's deputy city managerеКand director of economic development, said in an interview Friday.

The deal also offers no subsidies for Mountain View-based Google - a prospect that many didn't believe would be possible a few years ago.

""We always knew that ... to actually implement the Diridon Station area plan that we would need a private partner that could serve as a master developer,"" she said. ""The assumption from all of our advisers was that it would require significant financial subsidy or incentive to try to attract some developer from across the nation to come in here and take great risks to assemble the land into a cohesive whole.""

The deal would allow Google to purchase five sites owned by the SARA-owned properties for $67 million. That money would be split between 14 agencies and other stakeholders, leaving San Jose with about $9.5 million of those funds. But the two city-owned properties, the Fire Training Center at 255 S. Montgomery St. and another small slice of property at 697 West San Carlos, would solely benefit San Jose, and would sell for a combined amount of about $42.87 million.

San Jose plans to lease - for free - the Fire Training Center from Google for three years as it looks for a new location.

The agreement released Friday also leaves open an option for Google to buy more city-owned property in the future.

That additional property today serves as parking during San Jose Sharks games. But the potential deal would require some ""complex"" negotiating with the Sharks, according to San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo. The team has contractual agreements with the city to provide a minimum amount of parking close to the SAP Center, where the team plays.

If Google opts to buy the additional land, it'll first need the Sharks' blessing - and a robust parking plan for the hockey team.

""There needs to be suitable replacement to serve the arena and that solution will take time to emerge, but we are on a good path with all the parties,"" Liccardo said in an interview Friday.

See the map below for an idea of which properties are part of the agreement.

Google and its development ally, Trammell Crow, have been accumulating privately owned land in the area for more than a year, spending hundreds of millions of dollars on property so far.

Earlier this year, the company and the city kicked off community engagement around a potential development via a 38-member group, known as the Station Area Advisory Group, tasked with compiling goals and a broad vision for the area around Diridon Station.

While Google hasn't submitted a formal proposal for a campus to the city, the company has offered up some information about what it wants to do in the area. A future development would likely include 6 million to 8 million square feet of new development filled with up to 20,000 workers, it has said.

The company has also unveiled broad visions of what the streetscape would look like, replete with new retail, apartments, an ""eco-walk"" and promenades filled with art.

It's a prospect some in the community say would be a boon to a city in need of more office space and jobs for its tax base.

""UnlikeеКmanyеКother South Bay cities, San JosМ© does not have enough jobs for our very large resident population,"" San Jose City Manager Dave Sykes said in a statement Friday. ""This makes San JosМ© the most fiscally challenged city in the South Bay, and this causes lengthy commutes for residents. We appreciate having a major company such as Google willing to invest in Downtown and partner to achieve City development goals for the Station Area.

But others say they fear a massive Google campus would bring devastating gentrification and displacement to the diverse South Bay city. Those community members have held protests and two local advocacy groups this week filed a lawsuit against city over transparency concerns when it comes to the negotiations with Google thus far.

That lawsuit, however, will not affect the potential land sale or the framework of goals for a future development, according to Walesh.

Elected officials are slated to vote on the deal on Dec. 4. If the sale is approved, Google is expected to submit a formal development proposal in 2019, kicking off what will likely be a two-year process shepherding the plans to a final vote before development begins. (Read more about the expected timeline here.)

San Jose officials have anticipated that the Google project would take about a decade to come to fruition, assuming it is approved.

HIGHLIGHT:еКDecron Properties has bought the Willow Creek apartment complex in San Jose's Willow Glen district for $84.7 million.

SAN JOSE  The forbidding landscape for home buyers in the Bay Area hasеК prompted a real estate investment firm to buy a San Jose apartment complex a short rail ride from Googles proposed transit village in the downtown area.

Decron Properties has bought the Willow Creek apartment complex in Willow Glen for $84.6 million, the realty investment firm said Thursday.

Among the factors behind the purchase: The buyers believe apartments are becoming increasingly attractive alternatives as people are chased out of a brutal housing market by stubbornly high home prices.

Plus, the 208-unit complex, located at 935 Willowleaf Drive in San Jose, is a short walk from the Fruitdale light rail stop. That train stop is a 10-minute ride from Diridon Station, a rail hub thats the focal point of Googles transit-oriented community of office buildings, shops, restaurants, homes and open spaces where the search giant will employ 15,000 to 20,000 tech workers.

The proposed Google campus was a compelling reason for us and our investors to acquire this well-located property with long-term upside, saidеКDavid Nagel, president of Decron Properties.

The apartment purchase was arranged through the Palo Alto office of Institutional Property Advisors, a commercial real estate firm.

The median price for a home in San Jose is more than $860,000, pricing many residents out of the for-sale housing market and resulting in tremendous demand for quality rental housing, saidеКSalvatore Saglimbeni, senior managing director with Institutional Property Advisors.

The new owners intend to undertake a wide-ranging face lift of the apartment complex, built in 1985.

The interiors of the apartment units will be upgraded. In the common areas, each of the two pool areas will be renovated, and improvements will be undertaken to the fitness center, landscaping and exterior walls with a paint job.

The Willow Creek acquisition in San Jose marks Decrons second purchase of an apartment complex in the Bay Area this year.

In January, Decron Properties paid $87.4 million for the 220-unit Bridgecourt apartments atеК1325 40th St. in Emeryville.

Decron was drawn to a regulatory feature of the San Jose apartment complex, which operates under rules that require 20 percent, or 42 units, to be rented at below-market rates to tenants with household incomes at or below 60 percent of the area median income.

These units always will be in high demand, which will allow overall occupancy at the property to exceed market rate averages and help to generate strong and stable cash flows, Nagel said.",295,Julia Carrie Wong,14-Nov-18,Lawsuit Targets Secrecy Agreements Surrounding Google's New Campus;,497,The Guardian(london),Technology; Version:2,"Lawsuit Targets Secrecy Agreements Surrounding Google's New Campus;

Officials in San Jose, California, negotiating with Google over the tech company's plan to build a massive new campus, are improperly withholding documents, a lawsuit alleged on Tuesday.

The suit argues that non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) signed by San Jose mayor Sam Liccardo and as many as 18 city staffers at the request of Google were ""illegal and invalid"". It seeks to force the city to turn over documents requested under California's public records law.

""We are very afraid that there is a backroom deal happening,"" said Maria Noel Fernandez, deputy executive director of Working Partnerships USA, a labor and community organization that is one of two plaintiffs in the suit. ""It really does make me question what could possibly be so disturbing about this project that they have gone to these lengths to keep it secret.""

The most populous city in the San Francisco bay area, San Jose has been somewhat shielded from the region's gentrification and housing crises, as major companies elected to expand north of their Silicon Valley suburban office parks into San Francisco, rather than into the sprawling city to the south.

But Google's proposal to locate as many as 20,000 employees in a new development within the city limits has raised concerns about ""making San Jose a place where everyday people can no longer survive"", Fernandez said.

The lawsuit was filed the same day that Amazon ended a year-long process to choose a location for a second headquarters, a process that was notable for its extreme secrecy. After selecting 20 ""finalists"" from more than 200 vying to host the company's highly-paid workforce, Amazon required local officials to sign NDAs to keep the bidding war shielded from public scrutiny.

""It makes me very afraid that every concern I have for this project is true,"" said Fernandez of the news that a nearly $800bn company will be rewarded with almost $3.5bn in public subsidies by New York City, northern Virginia, and Nashville. ""These cities are bending over backwards to get these companies, at the cost of our communities.""

Requiring cities and counties to sign NDAs is a ""growing trend"", said David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, a government accountability group that is the other plaintiff against San Jose.

""Large powerful companies have a lot of leverage when they're dealing with municipalities and county governments, especially where they are small,"" Snyder said. ""The incentives for local governments just to sign overly broad NDAs are too strong. They have to be cognizant of their obligations to the public.""

Richard Doyle, the city attorney for San Jose, said that the negotiations with Google had been the ""most transparent"" of any development process in his 17 years with the city and that there was ""nothing illegal"" about the NDAs.

Still, he acknowledged that the city ""withheld certain documents that were deliberative and pertinent to the negotiation process"".

""We didn't want to show our hand,"" Doyle said.",296,Bloomberg,14-Nov-18,Google's San Jose Campus Triggers Lawsuit Over Land Deal Secrecy,875,National Real Estate Investor,,"Google's San Jose Campus Triggers Lawsuit Over Land Deal Secrecy

(Bloomberg)--San Jose, Calif., was sued by two nonprofit groups over a planned campus for tech giant Google, and what they contend are illegal nondisclosure agreements signed by city officials to help seal a $67 million land deal.

The NDAs were signed by San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo and at least 17 municipal officials, including city council members, according to a petition filed Tuesday in California Superior Court in Santa Clara. The litigation comes amid a larger effort by advocacy groups to use public deals to wrest concessions from huge Silicon Valley companies for the benefit of subcontractors and service employees.

City officials signed agreements ""designed to transform public records, on such crucial issues as transit and environmental compliance, into private ones that the public does not see,"" according to the filing. The ""city and Google went to extraordinary lengths to keep the public in the dark.""

The agreements are invalid under San Jose's municipal code, which restricts officials from entering into contracts without council approval, and violate state law barring agencies from letting outside parties control disclosures to the public, the plaintiffs said.

Google, based in nearby Mountain View, and San Jose have been negotiating over the sale of nine parcels of city-owned land as part of a larger, 6 to 8 million square foot development that could host 15,000 to 20,000 employees. Described as a Google ""village,"" it will be built around mass-transit and parkland in San Jose's Diridon Station area.

""This project is huge and is going to really change this city forever,"" said Maria Noel Fernandez, deputy director of Working Partnerships USA, a local union-backed nonprofit and one of the two plaintiffs in the case. She's also a member of the advisory group convened by the city for input on the project. ""We don't know what the city is hiding,"" Fernandez said.

""City leaders have a real incentive to deal with Google, and Google knows that,"" said David Snyder, executive director of plaintiff First Amendment Coalition, a government-transparency nonprofit. ""They can dictate the terms of the agreement."" Snyder said that, despite partial document production by the city, his group has been ""largely stonewalled"" in its requests for information about the deal and negotiations with Google.

The San Jose City Council has scheduled a vote for Dec. 4 on whether to let the project proceed. The plaintiffs are seeking a court order to release documents tied to the deal, including communications between the parties, as well as a declaration that the NDAs are invalid.

A lawyer for San Jose told Bloomberg the city believes the NDAs are valid, and that the city manager exercised his legal authority by allowing officials to sign them. ""To the extent we've withheld documents, it's deliberative, and directly related to the negotiations, and it's not a question of withholding,"" San Jose City Attorney Rick Doyle said. ""It's a question of timing of when we're releasing them.""

Google, which isn't named as a defendant, didn't respond to requests for comment.

Working Partnerships has spearheaded a push by labor and community groups in Silicon Valley to secure commitments from cities such as San Jose and companies like Google. The group wants protections for affordable housing and quality jobs for local residents that come with a right to unionize. In recent years, unions have successfully organized thousands of subcontracted staff, such as shuttle drivers and security guards, who serve Bay Area technology firms. They've accomplished this, in part, by pressing companies such as Facebook Inc. not to oppose unionization among their vendors' employees.

In the case of San Jose, the plaintiffs wrote that their ""petition seeks to bring sunlight into the process to enable the public to better evaluate the project's impacts on traffic, affordable housing, displacement and gentrification by obtaining public records shedding light upon what the City and Google did.""

A copy of one of the Google-San Jose NDAs, included with the court petition, stated that a party can disclose confidential information ""when compelled to do so by law"" but needs to first provide ""reasonable prior notice"" to the other party--unless ordered by a court not to do so. Doyle, the attorney for San Jose, told the San Jose Mercury News in February that Google sought the NDAs to cover ""a very sensitive negotiation"" between the parties.

U.S. companies ""make widespread use of NDAs in all aspects of their business,"" University of Pennsylvania management professor Peter Cappelli said in an email. This is especially the case in the technology sector.

""Virtually all companies use these,"" he said, hoping to safeguard their business secrets and avoid tipping competitors off to their plans. Some companies ask for NDAs before visitors even come onto their property, as well as from contractors or departing employees. The main policy concern raised by nondisclosure agreements, said Cappelli, arises when they prevent exposure of ""behavior that some would consider unethical, or at least unflattering to leaders who otherwise cannot be held accountable.""

COPYRIGHT",297,Janice Bitters,14-Nov-18,Google Is Gearing Up To Buy Prime San Jose Land For A New Tech Campus. What Now?,531,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Google Is Gearing Up To Buy Prime San Jose Land For A New Tech Campus. What Now?

The city of San Jose is on the verge of releasing details of a controversial 17-month negotiation to sell 20 acres of publicly owned land to tech giant Google for a massive new campus near downtown.

Those details, set to be released Friday, are a key milestone, but only the first step of making the Bay Area's largest city one of the next expansion points for Alphabet Inc.-owned Google, a plan that has been met by community members with both excitement, deep disdain, and as of this week, a lawsuit over transparency.

Now, as the release date of the long-anticipated land sale documents near, the question on the minds of both boosters of the Google expansion and skeptics is ""what now?""

First, the end goal: Google has said it wants to build a mixed-use campus that could span as large as 8 million square feet and would include housing, retail and office space next to transit. Somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 workers could show up each day at the campus if built out fully.

While that much is known, Google still doesn't own all the land it wants to assemble the campus, and it hasn't submitted any plans on how any buildings would look or what community benefits would come with the campus.

Public documents show those details are set to unfold in three key stages.

The San Jose City Council will first need to vote on whether to sell 16 key parcels - a swath of publicly owned slices of land around the Diridon transit hub - to Google. That vote will happen Dec. 4. The details of what the city is voting on will be released this week.

If elected officials agree to let Google purchase the land, the decision will kick off a planning and development process that could take a decade or more to come to fruition.

Google and the city started public engagement this year via a 37-member group of stakeholders known as the Station Area Advisory Group, or SAAG for short. Its meetings have culminated in a report of fears, hopes and dreams when it comes to a potential Google campus in San Jose, which was released this week.

Google has yet to unveil a formal proposal, which public officials say is expected to arrive at City Hall in 2019 and could take more than two years to shepherd to a final vote.

As part of that process, Google and the city will draft what is known as a development agreement, which is a document that outlines not only what will rise, but a myriad of other details, potentially including things like community benefits, a timeline, labor agreements or project partners.

In the background, San Jose city staff members will also be updating its zoning rules for the 230 acres around the Diridon Transit Station. Those updates are meant to be guided by the feedback the Station Area Advisory Group has provided and are likely to include updates to things like how high a developer can build or how dense an apartment building can be.

San Jose city officials say the buildout of the entire station area will likely take 20 years or more and will take many private property owners in addition to Google.

Well, Government Finances Get Kind Words From",718,The Mercury News (california),,"California Going Bankrupt? Well, Government Finances Get Kind Words From

HIGHLIGHT:еК""Compared with most states, California has assembled one of the strongest fiscal recoveries of the post-recession period,"" S&P analysts write.

With question swirling about the durability of California'sеКlong-running economic expansion, state finances got surprisingly kind words from three major credit-rating agencies.

I often hear critics of California's government claim the state is ill-prepared to pay its long-term bills, most notably retirement benefits promised to its workers. And in the short run, state coffers are especially vulnerable to swings in the broad economy as government revenues are deeply tied to unpredictable income-tax collections.

Yet so far in this economic cycle, such risks have yet to spook the Wall Street shops that review municipal finances.

Yes, the three major credit agencies gave 40-plus states higher ratings. But these agencies also gave California their fourth-highest grade for creditworthiness, a level described as ""high quality and subject to very low credit risk.""

Let's start with Moody's Investors Service, which took the boldest action of late.

Moody's has rated the state ""Aa3"" since June 2014, a steady improvement from a recessionary low of ""Baa1"" - four notches lower.еКAndеКMoody's recently upped its outlook for state finances to ""positive"" from ""stable,"" a hint that an official rating upgrade could happen in the next two years.

Moody's noted ""the state's improved financial position against its exposure to a highly volatile revenue structure. Long-term liability and fixed-cost burdens are slightly higher than state medians.""

S&P Global has seen California as an ""AA-minus"" risk since July 2015 after scoring the state at various levels of riskier ""A"" grade the previous 11 years.

In a recent ""stress test"" of state finances in worst-case scenarios, S&P analysts found the state's rainy-day fund - reserves for tough times boosted in size at Gov. Jerry Brown's insistence - could provide somewhat adequate protection.

The state's volatile revenue streams - heavily tied to how well the state's wealthiest residents fared financially - combined with numerous spending and savings mandates make budget management tricky in an economic downturn.

""A recession would strain the state's finances, but its efforts in recent years at shoring up its finances have paid off,"" S&P wrote. ""California's budget reserves, while now at record balances, may also be at something of the minimum necessary for it to withstand a recession.""

When Fitch Ratings recently graded the state for a major bond offering, it noted similar fiscal improvements as its peers did. Fitch has scored the state as ""AA-minus"" - its fourth-highest grade - since August 2016, up from ""BBB"" - five grades lower - mid-recession.

But Fitch analysts added a caveat, a nudge to Governor-elect Gavin Newsom for his dealings with budgetary issues and a legislature dominated by fellow Democrats: ""The rating is sensitive to the state's ability and willingness, both within the legislative and executive branches, to maintain fiscal discipline throughout the economic cycle.""

These upbeat reviews of California's creditworthiness are both a blessing and a curse for Newsom.

The good news is that Newsom won't immediately have to deal with tough, politically challenging budget realignments like Brown did. When Brown returned to the governorship for his second tour of duty in 2011, state finances were in shambles as the Great Recession was ending.

An eight-year economic recovery - and some budgetary process improvements - helped to right the state's fiscal ship.

""Compared with most states, California has assembled one of the strongest fiscal recoveries of the post-recession period,"" S&P wrote.

Amid the Great Recession's economic chaos, the state ran multibillion-dollar deficits. Last year, in far better times, the state ran an $8 billion surplus. But numerous forecasts show slowing growth for California's business climate.

Newsom got elected Nov. 6 with the state's creditworthiness is at its highest since the start of the century. The monetary management bar is high.

Google has just made a huge land deal in downtown San Jose",299,Janice Bitters,13-Nov-18,Google Campus Negotiations Prompt Advocacy Groups To Sue San Jose,776,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Google Campus Negotiations Prompt Advocacy Groups To Sue San Jose

The city of San Jose is facing a lawsuit filed Tuesday from two community and transparency advocacy groups aiming to shake loose more information about elected officials' negotiations with search giant Google to buy a swath of publicly owned land.

Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., and the city have spent the past 17 months formally negotiating the details around the sale of public lands in San Jose for a potential massive new mixed-use tech campus that could reach 8 million square feet in size and bring up to 20,000 Google employees to the area around Diridon Station.

On Friday, many of the details of the agreement around the sale are slated to become public ahead of a Dec. 4 vote by the City Council to sell about 20 acres of publicly owned land to Google.

But some local groups claim the city hasn't been transparent through the process, pointing to a set of closed-door meetings over the past year and non-disclosure agreements multiple city officials signed ahead of the June 9, 2017, public announcement that Mountain View-based Google was eyeing downtown San Jose for its next big Bay Area expansion.

The lawsuit, filed by government transparency group First Amendment Coalition and Working Partnerships USA, a community group that advocates for fair wages and affordable housing, among other issues, claims the city's non-disclosure agreements fly in the face of state laws around transparency.

""Working Partnerships USA and the First Amendment Coalition has brought this lawsuit against the city of San Jose to bring sunlight into the process so that we the public know the details of what Google and Mayor [Sam] Liccardo have pushed so hard to hide,"" Maria Noel Fernandez, deputy executive director for Working Partnerships USA, said at a press conference about the lawsuit.

The groups also accuse the city of being in breach of the state's Brown Act rules, which dictate when a meeting between public officials should be open to the public versus behind closed doors. Multiple attempts to get documents related to more than 20 closed-door meetings related to Google's land purchases have come up short of what is required by law, they claim.

""This lawsuit will pry those documents and that information loose,"" David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, said at the press event. ""California law is very clear. Government officials cannot contract way the public's right to know.""

San Jose City Attorney Rick Doyle pushed back on those accusations in an interview and said the city would respond to the lawsuit.

Doyle said he had no concerns about defending the legality of the city's actions related to the Google negotiations to date. ""No one was hiding from the California public records act or any kind of a state laws,"" he said.

The NDAs signed by city officials haven't been in use since the June 9, 2017 announcement, he said, emphasizing that the city has undertaken ""the most transparent project that I've seen,"" when it comes to the discussions around what Google should build.

Doyle noted, however, that the negotiations by the city so far have not been about the project that will rise in the city, but about the sale of land. Even with that limited scope, community advocates have said that the land sale is among the most critical components of the negotiation.

Fernandez told the Silicon Valley Business Journal last year that Working Partnerships USA fears that once the city sells the property to Google, the community will forfeit some of its negotiating power over what should rise and what sorts of public benefits the project must include.

Doyle confirmed that city council members did participate in closed-door sessions related to land sale negotiations with Google, but said that the city did the meetings by the book in accordance with the law.

Meanwhile, some of the missing documents that Working Partnerships and the First Amendment Coalition have been trying to obtain since earlier this summer may also become public in the coming weeks, now that the negotiations are all but wrapped up, he added.

""There have been some documents had been withheld that really get to the sort of negotiation strategy while the negotiations for the property sales had been pending,"" he said. ""We may revisit some of the documents that we ... have withheld because there may not be a need to withhold those any longer.""

Google did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit Tuesday. The company is not named as a defendant in the suit.

A recently released report by the city of San Jose highlights the simultaneous hopes and fears surrounding search giant Google's plans for a massive downtown campus.

On one hand is the hope that the campus would bring tens of thousands of high-paying jobs to San Jose and transform the area core into a vibrant, walkable city core. But there is also angst that the arrival of the tech behemoth and its workers will indelibly alter the fabric of the city and displace low-income and other vulnerable residents.

The city report was released just days before two advocacy groups sued the city Tuesday over the nondisclosure agreements San Jose officials signed with Mountain View-based Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., ahead of the planned sale of about 20 acres of publicly owned land near the Diridon transit station.

Residents of the neighborhoods involved and other stakeholders share the hope that Google's plans - which include up to 8 million square feet of office space focused on the planned Diridon transit hub - will be the catalyst that drives the evolution of downtown into the kind of big city nucleus that befits and benefits the capital of 21st century technology.

At the same time, they're fearful of somehow getting that evolution wrong - particularly in maintaining San Jose's ethnic, racial and economic diversity.

""There is deep fear with what this project is going to bring to the city for generations to come, but we believe it is actually possible (to get things right) if there is a will for folks to sit down and figure out how to do it,"" said Maria Noel Fernandez, spokeswoman for Working Partnerships USA, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit to get more information about what the city and Google have discussed.

That fear is reflected in the report's desired outcomes, collected during nine months of meetings and conversations involving the city-created Station Area Advisory Group, known as SAAG.

The report goes to some length to avoid ranking the concerns it gathered. But in the section on housing and displacement, it says they ""reflect a nearly universal concern for the housing crisis; however, there was a wide range of nuanced perspectives about how to meaningfully address it and the implications for the potential Google development in the Diridon area.""

The ultimate goal of the principle governing housing ""is no direct/indirect displacement from San Jose and no increase in homelessness,"" the report said. Respondents in the community engagement process said they want new resources from development by Google and other entities to go to more affordable housing and new ownership models, such as community land trusts, that increase home ownership possibilities.

The area in which there was the most agreement among respondents was in the desired outcomes for public spaces, creeks and trails. They want these spaces to be open to everyone and incorporate a signature plaza at Diridon that is useful for gathering, events and facilitates circulation.

On transportation and transit, the respondents want to support transit use, walking and cycling ""while also proactively managing vehicle traffic, parking and emerging modes of travel.""

There was a wide range of priorities concerning jobs, education and economic development. Some respondents were strong on letting the school district tailor instruction as it sees fit and others called a range of job training in specific sectors identified as ""high growth"" such as construction, information technology, manufacturing, healthcare and business.

The parking section of land-use design reflects uncertainty about whether and how long automobiles will be a primary transportation mode. Several of the suggestions for parking called for plans and structures that can easily be adapted to fewer automobiles if Diridon's transit potential develops as city planners hope.

HIGHLIGHT:еКSome proponents of economic growth hope that significantly taller buildings will be allowed in downtown San Jose, which, due to its proximity to the city's international airport, has a flattened look, an array of boxy mesas of hotels, office towers and residential high rises.

SAN JOSE  Efforts to create a new generation of higher towers in downtown San Jose are near success  with the trade-off being minor impacts on a few overseas flights  according to San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo.

Some proponents of economic growth hope that significantly taller buildings will be allowed in downtown San Jose, which is beneath the flight path for the citys international airport and has a flattened look, withеКboxy hotels, office towers and residential high rises.

We are working earnestly to find a path to reach both objectives, taller buildings downtown and a strong and growing airport,еК Liccardo said in an interview.

Multiple key neighborhoods of downtown San Jose  including a western section of the citys urban heart where Google plans a transit-oriented community of office buildings, homes, stores and restaurants near the Diridon train station  have height constraints to ensure jetliners can soar safely above the structures.

Were in negotiations with the airlines about the height limits, Liccardo said. There are potential trade offs to get higher buildings downtown.

Two or three airlines, primarily those that connect Asia and San Jose, might be affected. As an example, they might fly with a bit less cargo or fewer passengers, potentially with five empty seats or so, according to the mayor. That would lighten the planes so they could safely clear the tops of taller buildings.

Experts who are familiar with the downtown believe it makes sense to pave a smoother path to construct higher buildings in the city center.

Developers can generate more revenue with taller buildings, and once you are not so limited in height, you can start adding more interesting architectural features, said Nick Goddard, a senior vice president with Colliers International, a commercial realty brokerage. You can add spires, buildings constructed in a wedding-cake pattern, more variety.

Plus, pressure could intensify to construct higher buildings in the downtown due to the expansion plans by tech giants Google and Adobe Systems, as well as the prospect that Diridon Station will add a BART stop and high-speed rail connection, in addition to the existing light rail, Caltrain, Amtrak, ACE Train and Capitol Corridor lines that new serve the transit hub.

This is going to be downtown San Jose 2.0, said Bob Staedler, principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a land use and planning consultancy. The downtown will have a Grand Central Station of the West. So taller buildings make more sense, because property values will be going up.

Over the 12 months that ended in September, investors spent $1.43 billion purchasing downtown San Jose properties, according to Santa Clara County property records and this news organizations analysis of the property transactions. Thats nearly three times the $484 million in downtown San Jose property purchases over the one-year period that ended in September 2017.

We dont have to be confined to the squat, little skyline downtown San Jose has had for so long, Staedler said.

The airline industrys trade association referred inquiries to the Federal Aviation Administration.

Under federal law, the FAA must be given the opportunity to review every proposed tall structure near an airport, and any proposed structure over 200 feet high, to determine if it would pose a hazard to air traffic or navigation aids, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said Wednesday. The FAAs determination is only a recommendation. We dont have authority over local building decisions.

Its also possible that the state Transportation Departments Aeronautics Division might weigh in on the matter.

The FAA doesnt have a blanket building height limit that it applies to structures near airports, according to Gregor.

We evaluate structure by structure, Gregor said.",302,Emily Deruy,9-Nov-18,Google Coming To San Jose Sparks Fear Of Soaring Housing Costs,669,The East Bay Times (california),,"Google Coming To San Jose Sparks Fear Of Soaring Housing Costs

HIGHLIGHT:еКA new report takes stock of concerns and opportunities surrounding Google's planned San Jose campus.

With Google expected to build a massive San Jose campus in the coming years, a new report takes stock of the projects possible benefits like a revitalized downtown and its potential drawbacks  soaring housing costs and displaced residents.

The report, published by the city with input from a number of community organizations and residents, comes just weeks before Dec. 4, when the City Council is expected to approve the sale of some 20 acres of land near Diridon Station to the tech company.

Since February, the Station Area Advisory Group, a group of nearly 40 people including Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a business advocacy group that counts Google among its members and Maria Noel Fernandez of Silicon Valley Rising, an organization that has raised concerns about gentrificationеК  has met monthly to discuss what the project could and should mean for the future of San Jose.

And while the 83-page document does not represent a list of the citys priorities for the area in the coming decades or even a consensus, it provides a snapshot of how a wide-range of people and organizations who stand to be affected view the proposed redevelopment.

The top issue is the fear of displacement from San Jose due to rising housing prices, the report notes. The top opportunity is for the revitalization of the Diridon area and expansion of the downtown.

Even before the Google campus was proposed, the area around Diridon Station was set to transform dramatically with the possibility of high-speed rail connecting to the station and BART coming to San Jose.

The report will inform the citys negotiations with Google, particularly as the company moves into the actual planning and development phase of the project.

Already, the report says, the input gathered through the civic engagement process has been valuable in shaping Google's initial design thinking and illuminating top community priorities.

Predictably, housing and displacement topics dominated the advisory groups discussions. Jobs, education and environmental concerns also came up.

The report indicates that participants generally agreed that there should be no displacement and no increase in homelessness as a result of the project. Whether that wish becomes a reality remains to be seen  already San Jose residents just south of the area say they have seen home prices rise on the announcement that Google is coming to town.

Participants also said that the increased economic opportunity Google could bring to San Jose should be open to all.

The report also included responses from an online survey, which generated a disproportionate number of responses from homeowners and white residents. The survey showed there was little agreement on some issues  for instance whether the city should acquire and preserve the affordability of apartment buildings in places most at risk of gentrification. But many respondents agreed on other issues such as that the area should include publicly accessible parks and green space.

Initial plans suggest Google wants to build 6-8 million square feet of office and R&D space along with retail and other amenities on about 50 acres. The company has said the project could result in around 20,000 jobs.

The project isnt a certainty yet. Google wants to buy a number of city-owned surface level parking lots around the SAP Center and the Sharks, whose fans park in the lots, have pushed back. Already they have sued to preserve parking around the arena that would likely disappear as BART is extended toward Diridon.

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe entry level vehicle may be built at VW's factory in Emden, Germany, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan hasn't received final approval by the manufacturer's supervisory board. Sales could start sometime after 2020, and the company expects to sell about 200,000 per year, they said.

By Christopher Rauwald | Bloomberg News

Volkswagen plans to add a subcompact crossover costing about 18,000 euros ($21,000) to its all-electric I.D. range, expanding its lineup of zero-emissions vehicles that are more affordable than those of Tesla Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.

The entry level vehicle may be built at VWs factory in Emden, Germany, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan hasnt received final approval by the manufacturers supervisory board. Sales could start sometime after 2020, and the company expects to sell about 200,000 per year, they said.

That would put it on par with current production levels of the more-expensive Tesla Model 3, the U.S. electric-car leaders most affordable vehicle, which is due to arrive in Europe next year.

The I.D. range is at the heart of one of the auto industrys most aggressive electric-car initiatives  a plan to put 50 models on the road across the group, including volume brands such as VW, Seat and Skoda. The worlds largest automaker plans to use its massive scale to offer less-expensive e-cars than rivals like Tesla, hoping to blunt their early advantage as more consumers adopt zero-emissions vehicle.

The first in the lineup is the I.D. Neo, which will be made at Zwickau, Germany, and begin sales in 2020. With less complexity and fewer model variants, VW may be able to produce the car in roughly half the time needed to assemble a Golf hatchback, according to the people. VW has said it will be sold for a price of a comparable diesel car, suggesting a price tag of roughly 23,000 euros.

A mid-sized electric sedan and station wagon named I.D. Aero could add production of another 100,000 cars per year at the Emden plant, as VW seeks to safeguard employment. The factory so far relies on the Passat sedan and station wagon, which would move to the Czech site of sister brand Skoda in Kvasiny around 2022, according to the people. The Emden factory faced several production halts this year due to sluggish demand as consumers increasingly opt for SUVs.

In China, VW intends to expand electric-car production beyond a factory in Anting and a site in Foshan that have been selected already to make purely battery-powered cars as of 2020. In North America, VW plans to make electric cars at the companys only U.S. vehicle factory in Chattanooga.

The production revamp, dubbed project Polaris internally, is part of a large-scale overhaul aimed at allocating vehicle manufacturing more efficiently across VWs stable of 12 automotive brands. VW is seeking to wring billions of euros in savings for its e-car push, through closer cooperation between brands and measures such as the culling of slow-selling models, trims and color options.

Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess said in a recent interview the company might license its new electric-car technology, dubbed MEB, to Ford Motor Co. as part of the two companies cooperation talks. VW is also discussing sharing the technology with other global automakers, according to the people. Teaming up with peers to share costs marks a strategy shift for the German manufacturer, as cooperation efforts in the past have often been bogged down by cultural differences.

As part of the investment push, VW plans to built a new factory in an East European country like Hungary or Bulgaria. That would allow it to benefit from lower labor costs with an annual production capacity of 350,000 cars, including for cars that are currently made at Skodas Kvasiny site but need to make way for the Passat.

Earlier media reports about shifting the Passat away from Germany and replacing it with electric cars sparked concern among VWs workforce as the speed with which consumers switch to battery-powered cars remains uncertain. In addition to the plans at Emden and Zwickau, VW will also replace the successor of the iconic Microbus made in Hanover with a planned electric iteration dubbed I.D. Buzz. The next combustion version of the Microbus successor could be built at a Ford factory in Turkey.

HIGHLIGHT:еКStartup Starcity plans to build nearly 800 units in downtown San Jose, and another 270 in San Francisco.

Click HERE if you're unable to view the gallery on your mobile device.

SAN JOSE  The latest trendy newеКapartment building coming to downtown San Jose will offer plenty of luxury amenities, including cleaning services, laundry and dog walking. The catch? Each resident will share a kitchen and living room with at least a dozen other strangers.

The nearly 800-unit building, set to break ground early next year,еКis the latest project to embrace co-living  a dorm-like set-up where residents sleep in small private bedrooms and share common spaces, as a way to pack more people into a building and keep rents down. Its a lifestyle thats becoming increasingly popular as Bay Area residents, grappling with sky-high housing costs, are forced to find ever-more creative ways to stay afloat, and developers areеКencouraged to come up withеКinnovative methods to house more people faster.

The San Jose project will be the largest co-living building in the world, according to its developer, San Francisco-based communal housing startup Starcity. The company also has a 270-unit co-living building in the works in San Franciscos SoMa neighborhood. The two projects, both slated to open in 2021, will be the startups first attempts at building from the ground up instead of renovating existing buildings. Together they mark a major expansion by Starcity, and would increase the companys existing inventory by more than 10-fold.

I think about actually making a dent in the supply to the point where people who are somewhere else in the country, or living nearby, or commuting hours and hours and hours can say, OK now theres a way for me to get into the city, said Starcity co-founder and CEO Jon Dishotsky.еКCommuting is a pain in the butt, fitting four people to a two-bedroom is a pain in the butt and paying 70 percent of your income is not enjoyable.

Starcity, which originally bought empty or underutilized residential and commercial buildings and turned them into housing, made its co-housingеКdebut by converting a Victorian house and garage into a six-unit shared livingеКspace in San Francisco in 2016. Now the startup operates 81 units in five buildings  four in San Francisco and one in Los Angeles. In the next year, the company plans to finish another 600 units in San Francisco and more than 400 in Los Angeles.

The co-living trend is part of a broader creative movement sweeping the Bay Areas housing market. Entrepreneurs are finding a range of innovative solutions to the regions housing shortage  from turning shipping containers into tiny homes, to building micro-houses in peoples backyards, to providing new ways for renters to build equity and save for down payments.

People are rethinking how to live, and what housing means, and how its provided, said Chris Calott, a development and architecture professor at UC Berkeley.

Starcitys upcoming San Jose building, located at 199 Bassett еКthree blocks from the Diridon Caltrain station, near where Google has proposed a new campus for up to 20,000 workers еК will have up to 790 units. Each renter will have his or her own private bedroom and adjoining bathroom, or will share a bathroom with a family member or pre-selected friend. Between 12 and 18 people will share each kitchen and living room, and there will be four kitchens and living rooms per floor.

Both the San Jose building and the San Francisco building will cater to residents making between $40,000 and $120,000 a year. Rooms likely will rent for $800 to $2,500  below the current market rates for one-bedroom apartments in both cities.

The average rent for a one-bedroomеКapartment in San Jose is $2,364, according to RentCafe. Its $3,261еКin San Francisco.

Starcity can keep its costs down because its properties are more dense, Dishotsky said. By removing a buildings living rooms, kitchens and hallways and turning them into bedrooms, StarcityеКcan fit more people into the building, collect rent from more tenants, and lower everyones prices.

Even so, Starcitys price tags likely puts its rooms out of reach for many local residents.

When youre co-housing and youre still paying $2,000 for a room, thats not sustainable, said Kate Comfort Harr, executive director of San Mateo County-based nonprofit HIP Housing. It might be part of the solution, but at that price point its only going to be a solution for a very few.

Don Row, a 43-year-old pilot, moved into a room in a San Francisco Starcity building in February, after striking out trying to find a roommate on Craigslist as he prepared to relocate to the Bay Area from Phoenix. Row, who says he moved for the weather, now pays $2,200 a month for a private bedroom and two kitchens he shares with 10 other people.

Row admits he hadnt always pictured himself ending up in a dorm-style apartment in his 40s, and he doesnt necessarily think hell live there forever. But for now, his only complaint is a lack of shelf space in the communal refrigerators.

It is definitely not a traditional path by any stretch of the imagination, Row said. I can see why some people might think it would be weird.

HIGHLIGHT:еКAn office tower planned for downtown San Jose next to the Tech Museum would total 850,000 square feet, a substantial increase from the original proposal for the site of 250,000 square feet of offices, according to planning documents submitted by a group led by realty entrepreneur Gary Dillabough.

SAN JOSE - A striking office tower where more than 4,000 people could work has been proposed for downtown San Jose, part of the crucial Museum Place development that would also dramatically expand The Tech Museum of Innovation.

The high-rise office complex would total 850,000 square feet, a substantial increase from the original proposal for the site of 250,000 square feet, according to planning documents submitted by Museum Place Owner, a group led by realty entrepreneur Gary Dillabough.

""The idea is to really make this a world-class development, and to make this a world-class office tower that would appeal to a high-tech tenant,"" Dillabough said Thursday.

The original proposal for Museum Place had called for an office building, hotel and residences, along with ground-floor retail and the Tech Museum expansion.

With the new plans, submitted to San Jose officials this week, the hotel rooms and residences are gone, replaced by the new office tower. The Tech expansion and the ground floor retail remain in the works.

The new tower could be 19 stories high, Dillabough said. However, if federal height limits related to San Jose airport jetliner flights are eased, the tower could be 20 or 21 stories.

""This is about place-making and building something that can be seen from miles away,"" said Bob Staedler, principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a land-use and planning consultancy.

Being able to construct an office tower that is as high as feasible would bolster efforts to transform downtown San Jose with a more memorable skyline.

""For a healthy downtown, verticality is really important,"" Dillabough said. ""We are looking at 19 floors, but we would like to go higher another floor or two.""

The development is a short distance from the site where San Jose-based Adobe Systems is planning to expand its three-building downtown headquarters campus by constructing an adjacent tower that could double the company's workforce.

Across the street, Jay Paul in August paid $284 million for the huge Cityview Plaza office, retail and restaurant complex, a site that several experts believe will be bulldozed and replaced by a modern tech campus, possibly totaling 1 million square feet.

Next to Museum Place, veteran developerеКJ.P. DiNapoli Cos. is planning a 19-story office tower totaling 740,000 square feet.

A few blocks to the west, Google plans a transit-oriented development of offices, homes, stores, restaurants and parks where 15,000 to 20,000 of the tech giant's employees would work.

Including the Google development and the Adobe expansion, as many as 36,000 employees could be added to downtown San Jose, if all of these office buildings are constructed and filled with workers. In a head-spinning comparison, SPUR estimated in 2014 that downtown San Jose had about 39,500 office workers.

""Having taller buildings would help Google justify all the investments they are making in this area,"" Dillabough said.

The current plans for the Tech Museum expansion call for a 63,000-square-foot addition. Dillabough also intends to develop 20,000 square feet of retail and restaurants that would help create a vibrant pedestrian-friendly walking area along the increasingly important Park Avenue.

""The ground floor commercial facing Park Avenue will be one of the most interesting components of the project,"" Dillabough said.",307,,1-Nov-18,Q3 2018 Hudson Pacific Properties Inc Earnings Call - Final,8597,Fd (fair Disclosure) Wire,,"Q3 2018 Hudson Pacific Properties Inc Earnings Call - Final

Presentation

OPERATOR: Greetings, and welcome to Hudson Pacific Properties' Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Laura Campbell, Senior Vice President, IR and Marketing. Thank you. You may begin.

LAURA CAMPBELL, VP & HEAD OF IR, HUDSON PACIFIC PROPERTIES, INC.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Hudson Pacific Properties' Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Earlier today, our press release and supplemental were filed on an 8-K with the SEC. Both are now available on the Investor Relations section of our website, hudsonpacificproperties.com. An audio webcast of this call will also be available for replay by phone over the next week and on the Investor Relations section of our website.

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to our GAAP financial results in our press release and supplemental. We will also be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings. Actual events could cause our results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, which we undertake no duty to update.

With that, I'd like to welcome Victor Coleman, our Chairman and CEO; Mark Lammas, our COO and CFO; and Art Suazo, our EVP of Leasing. Victor will give an overview of our performance, Art will discuss leasing activity in our market and Mark will touch on financial highlights. Note, they will be joined by other senior management during the Q&A portion of our call. Victor?

VICTOR J. COLEMAN, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT & CEO, HUDSON PACIFIC PROPERTIES, INC.: Thanks, Laura, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2018 call. Our West Coast markets continue to outperform driven by the further growth and expansion of tech and media companies. The third quarter of '18 prove to be our most productive quarter ever in terms of office leasing and rounds out the most successful 4 consecutive quarters of office leasing in our history.

We signed 1.2 million square feet of leases in the quarter at 28% GAAP and 12% cash rent spreads. Putting a finer point on the strength of our markets, those spreads were 31% and 28%, respectively, excluding our Netflix renewal, which I'll discuss more in a moment. We're now on track to have our best year ever in terms of office leasing.

Year-to-date, we signed 2.6 million square feet of deals at 28% GAAP and 14% cash rent spreads. Again, this translates to 28% GAAP and 19% cash rent spreads growth, excluding the Netflix renewal. Robust tenant demand at our Peninsula and Silicon Valley office assets has been a key driver of our phenomenal leasing momentum.

Year-to-date, we've signed 1.3 million square feet at these properties, which represent 60% of non-development -- or redevelopment leasing. This quarter alone, a handful of our remaining leased up assets located in the Peninsula and Silicon Valley contributed to 100,000 square feet of positive absorption within our portfolio.

Techmart and Palo Alto Square are now stabilized at 98% and 95%, respectively. This quarter Gateway reached 93% leased, and upon extending 80,000-square-foot lease with Nutanix post-quarter, Metro Plaza, one of our priority large block availabilities discussed at our Investor Day, is now 92% leased.

With regard to other priority large block availabilities noted at our Investor Day, we signed 132000-square-foot lease with Honey Science for the entirety of Fourth & Traction redevelopment asset in the Arts District. As expected, we achieved Westside Los Angeles level rents. A testament to both the quality and uniqueness of the project, along with a growing demand for office space in the Arts District. Spotify, Warner Music and now, Honey, will bring an aggregate of 2,600 new employees to that marketplace.

The private members' club, Soho House, will open before year-end. Nearly 800 high-end residential units we'll deliver over the next 6 month. All this bodes very well for our other Arts District redevelopment, MaxWell. There's virtually no competitive office space and we have very good leasing activity in the property, which we'll deliver by year-end.

We also leased our entire 300000-square-foot-plus award-winning EPIC development -- I mean, Hollywood to Netflix. At the same time, we renewed their ICON and CUE leases, all which go until 2031. These 3 assets are the core of Netflix's LA urban production campus. Our studio portfolio uniquely enables us to provide them with immediate access to soundstages, production offices and support services essential to their business. In addition to EPIC, ICON and CUE, Netflix currently has leases for just over 190,000 square feet of stages and production offices at Sunset Bronson and Sunset Gower. We anticipate the utilization of our studio assets will continue to grow in the future.

We're swiftly addressing our remaining '18 and '19 expirations with regard to the remaining 350,000 square feet of fourth quarter '18 expirations we renewed or backfilled 39%; and our proposals, LOIs or leases on another 25%. As for the remaining 1.3 million square feet of '19 expirations, we renewed or backfilled 34%; and our proposals, LOIs and leases for another 21%. We view these expirations as meaningful opportunities to drive organic growth. The mark-to-market is 28% on our remaining fourth quarter '18 expirations, and 18% on our remaining '19 expirations.

We've also been very focused on capital recycling. We've taken full advantage of strong asset sales in the Peninsula and Silicon Valley to sell non-core properties and generate cash flow. To put this in perspective, to date, we sold $830 million of assets from the original $3.5 billion Blackstone portfolio. This quarter, we sold the remaining 6 Pacific office park buildings at a 14% premium to our purchase price. The quality of this asset and its more suburban, non-transit-centric location in San Mateo did not align with our long-term strategy for Peninsula and Silicon Valley holdings like those in Palo Alto and the San Jose airport.

We're now pursuing a sale of Campus Center in Milpitas, which we anticipate will generate a positive return. While we've not halted our leasing efforts, given the growing demand for tech giants for Silicon Valley industrial R&D and manufacturing products, we feel very good about our ability to create value from this asset. Case in point, last week, Apple signed a 300,000-square-foot industrial manufacturing lease next to our Campus Center.

Electric vehicle maker, SF Motors, signed 136,000-square-foot lease earlier this year at the same project. Late last year, Google bought 560,000 square feet of industrial in North San Jose. And this summer, Micron Technology, leased 600,000 square feet in North San Jose. In short, we expect the Campus Center sale would generate a lot of interest for this type of non-office end users.

We're using a combination of sales proceeds and joint venture capital to fund strategic, value-additive projects in our core markets. Our growth initiatives, so far, this year, have been focused on downtown San Francisco, West Los Angeles and Hollywood. In this quarter, Macerich contributed the Westside Pavilion mall valued at $190 million through our 75-25 joint venture. We're making good progress on entitlements for the 500,000-plus square foot creative office campus redevelopment, which we're calling One Westside. Schematic designs are 50% complete and this one-of-a-kind project is slated for delivery by mid-2021. And as previously noted, we're already feeling very strong interest from multiple full and partial building users.

Last month, we announced a 55-45 joint venture with Allianz to purchase the world-renowned San Francisco Ferry Building for $291 million. We're driving cash flow at that asset in the near term through a commencement of signed leases and renewing and/or backfilling roughly 1/4 of the office square footage with leases that are, on average, 28% below market. These 2 drivers alone get us about 200 basis points of additional yield by beginning of 2020.

Not accounted for in this base case underwriting is that we're also fine-tuning plans to add new programs, amenities and events to drive visitor and tenant interest and to capitalize on the ferry terminal expansion project, which will increase ferry users from 10,000 to 24,000 per day in 2019. Where some saw a core opportunity in this iconic asset, we see and have the creativity and capabilities to realize a significant amount of upside. It's an exciting project.

Now I'm going to turn the call over to Art for further commentary on leasing end markets.

ARTHUR X. SUAZO, EVP OF LEASING, HUDSON PACIFIC PROPERTIES, INC.: Thanks, Victor. We feel very good about our fundamentals in our markets and the level of activity at our assets. Well-capitalized tech companies, big and small, and streaming media and content-related businesses, continue to grow exponentially. There are a finite number of big blocks of space in the right locations with access to the right talent, and the larger companies are rapidly absorbing existing and future supply to stay competitive.

This is fueling further rent growth, significant levels of absorption and declining vacancy in our already very tight markets. We're still pushing rate and extending term across our portfolio, while concessions remain consistent. And our leasing pipeline, that is deals and proposals, LOIs or leases, stands at 1.4 million square feet, even as we've signed 1.2 million square feet of deals in the third quarter.

Let's go first to Silicon Valley, wherefore this discussion excludes Palo Alto. In the third quarter alone, tenants signed 7 leases greater than 100,000 square feet in the Valley, including 470,000-square-foot lease with Locu, 350,000-square-foot lease with Amazon and 290,000-square-foot lease with Splunk. Nearly 400,000 square feet of positive net absorption in the quarter, drove vacancy down about 70 basis points to 8.8%, while Class A rents were stable at $63 per square foot. Year-to-date, the Valley had a phenomenal 3.2 million square feet of positive net absorption.

North San Jose, in particular, has tightened with year-to-date positive net absorption of 776,000 square feet, a 5% year-over-year increase in Class A rents to $43 per square foot and a 440 basis point vacancy decline of 13.8%. At our assets, we're capturing both rent and occupancy upside. For example, in the third quarter, our 73,000-square-foot lease with Nutanix and Concourse had a 25% mark-to-market. Overall, our stabilized Silicon Valley portfolio is 97.5% leased, with in-place leases 12% below market. Our approximately 500,000 square feet of remaining fourth quarter 2018 and 2019 expirations are 20% below market.

Further north along the Peninsula, which for this discussion, includes Palo Alto, market conditions remain solid. In the third quarter, 86,000 square feet of positive net absorption kept vacancy low at 7.1%, while Class A rents were up 5% to $85 per square foot. Similar to the Valley, pent-up demand for larger blocks is enabling landlords like ourselves to drive rate. In the third quarter, we signed a 50,000-square-foot lease with Poshmark at Towers at the Shore Center with an impressive 89% mark-to-market.

We recently completed a series of capital improvements at our Redwood Shores assets, including common area upgrades and specs we build-out in anticipation of 300,000 square feet expiring at these properties in 2019. We already have coverage. That is, deals renewed, backfilled in proposals, LOIs or leases on 63% of that space, with an average 12% mark-to-market on those leases. We have room to get deals done. Overall, our stabilized Peninsula portfolio is 88.5% leased, with in-place leases 16% below market. Our roughly 600,000 square feet of remaining fourth quarter 2018 and 2019 expirations are 14% below market.

San Francisco is achieving both record rents on positive net absorption levels. Year-to-date, 13 leases greater than 100,000 square feet have been signed in that market, and we expect another 1 million square feet of large deals by year-end. During the third quarter, positive net absorption of 1.2 million square feet reduced vacancy by 50 basis points to 4.7%, while rents increased 3% to $82 per square foot. Year-to-date, San Francisco have seen 7% rent growth and a record 3.3 million square feet of positive net absorption. Our stabilized San Francisco portfolio is 94.1% leased, with in-place leases 40% below market.

Google recently completed a fantastic build-out and moved into 166,000 square feet at Rincon Center. Our only other significant availability is our newly converted 66,000 square foot former bank vault space at 1455 Market, where we have interest from multiple tenants at rents equivalent to approximately 200% mark-to-market. Our approximately 200,000 square feet of remaining fourth quarter 2018 and 2019 expirations are 29% below market.

In Los Angeles, our portfolio remains unmatched in terms of product type, asset quality and location. Year-to-date, Hollywood and West LA had a combined 1 million square feet of positive net absorption. In Hollywood, during the third quarter, Class A rents increased 6% to $60 per square foot with vacancy essentially unchanged at 10.1%. West LA rents were steady at $62 per square foot with vacancy following 50 basis points to 11.1%.

In the greater LA office market, during the quarter, our Netflix lease was the largest deal signed, and our Honey lease was the third largest deal signed. We're seeing great activity on the balance of our 1 million square feet of under construction and near-term plan to development and redevelopment properties. Our stabilized Los Angeles portfolio is 99.1% leased, with in-place leases 16% below market. Our roughly 225,000 square feet of remaining fourth quarter 2018 and 2019 expirations are 24% below market.

Finally, in Seattle, our primary holdings are concentrated in downtown, which remains the region's most active office market. In the third quarter, downtown submarkets collectively comprised 800,000 square feet of the 1 million square feet of positive net absorption in the broader Puget Sound office market. And currently, vacancy fell 40 basis points to 8.2% with $45 per square foot Class A rents. Our stabilized portfolio is 96.8% leased and in-place leases are 23% below market.

We're focused on lease-up of the remaining floors totaling 55,000 square feet at 450 Alaskan and incremental availability at our recently delivered 95 Jackson development, with good activity at both assets. We now have backfilled just over 80% of the 2019 Capital One expiration at a weighted 39% mark-to-market and are focused on addressing roughly 175,000 square feet of remaining fourth quarter 2018 and 2019 expirations, which are 35% below market.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for financial highlights.

MARK T. LAMMAS, COO, CFO & TREASURER, HUDSON PACIFIC PROPERTIES, INC.: Thanks, Art. In the third quarter, we generated FFO, excluding specified items of $0.47 per diluted share compared to $0.50 per diluted share a year ago. Strategic capital recycling, specifically $850 million of non-core asset sales over the last 4 quarters, was the primary driver of this sequential decrease. Specified items in the third quarter consisted of transaction expenses of $200,000 or $0.00 per diluted share compared to specified items consisting of transaction expenses of $600,000 or $0.00 per diluted share a year ago.

Our record third quarter office leasing activity that Victor and Art discussed, contributed to positive net absorption throughout our portfolio. Quarter-over-quarter, we achieved a 100 basis point increase in our stabilized office portfolio lease percentage to 94.6% and a 180 basis points increase in our in-service office portfolio lease percentage to 91.4%.

In the third quarter, NOI at our 31 same-store office properties increased 3.2% on a GAAP basis and 2.5% on a cash basis. As noted in our press release, the quarterly cash basis comparison is muted by a $3.2 million onetime tenant improvement cost reimbursement received in 2017, which we excluded last year and in the current year for purposes of the same-store office cash NOI growth guidance estimates. Third quarter and year-to-date same-store office cash NOI adjusted for this onetime item, reflects growth of 7.6% and 4.3%, respectively.

In the third quarter, the trailing 12-month lease percentage for the 3 same-store studio properties, inclusive of Sunset Las Palmas Studios, was 88.9%. Note, there is no applicable trailing 12-month comparison for third quarter 2017 given that Sunset Las Palmas was acquired in mid-2017. However, as a point of reference, the trailing 12-month lease percentage for Sunset Gower and Sunset Bronson Studios, increased 30 basis points year-over-year to 90.9%.

Our same-store studio NOI increased by 12.6% on a GAAP basis and decreased by 3% on a cash basis. Again, as noted in our press release, the cash basis comparison is muted by a $700,000 onetime tenant improvement cost reimbursement received in 2017. Third quarter and year-to-date same-store studio cash NOI adjusted for this onetime item reflects growth of 6.4% and 11.9%, respectively.

Note that starting in the third quarter, our 3 months same-store studio NOI comparisons includes Sunset Las Palmas, while year-to-date comparisons continue to include only Sunset Gower and Sunset Bronson. Beginning in 2019, Sunset Las Palmas, which I mentioned was acquired in mid-2017, will qualify for same-store year-to-date comparisons.

Victor touched on the contribution of One Westside and 10850 Pico to our joint venture with Macerich during the third quarter. In connection with this transaction, we diffused a $139 million loan by purchasing U.S. government securities. Since the joint venture owns the successor/borrower for the diffused loan, both the loans outstanding balance and the securities collateralized in that loan are reflected on our balance sheet. Interest expense for that loan as well as interest income from the securities are likewise included in our statement of operations. Since the diffused loan is collateralized with U.S. government securities, unless required for GAAP accounting or covenant compliance purposes, certain leverage metrics such as the debt-to-market capitalization ratio reported in our supplemental, may not include either the loan or securities.

Turning to guidance. We are narrowing our full year 2018 FFO guidance to a range of $1.84 to $1.88 per diluted share, excluding specified items, maintaining the $1.86 midpoint last provided on October 10, 2018, in connection with the Ferry Building acquisition announcement. Specified items consist of $300,000 of transaction expenses, a $400,000 write-off of original issuance cost related to the recast of our credit facility in 5- and 7-year term loan facilities and $900,000 of unrealized gains from changes in fair value on non-real estate investments. As a reminder, our full year 2018 FFO guidance excludes the impact of unannounced or speculative acquisitions, dispositions, financings and capital markets activity.

One final word about guidance. Some of you may have seen reports that Twilio re-leased -- recently subleased 259,000 square feet from Salesforce at Rincon Center in San Francisco. The mark-to-market for that space prove to be over 60% of the in-place rents, our participation in which will ultimately be meaningful as the sublease phases in over the next 2 years. Since the first days of that sublease is not projected to commence until December, our profit participation is not expected to materially impact fourth quarter or full year 2018 FFO. We intend to provide further information regarding the sublease and its impact in 2019 and beyond in next quarter supplemental report.

With that, I'll turn the call back to Victor.

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Thank you, Mark. To summarize, we're successfully assembling the remaining building blocks to reach our goal of 18% NOI growth from first quarter 2018 through 2019, plus another 14% post-2019. We're doing this by tackling our '18 and '19 expirations, by stabilizing our lease-up assets and by pre-leasing our development pipeline, all of which are well on track.

For the last several quarters, we've capitalized on strong investment markets to sell nonstrategic assets. Aside from the pending sale of Campus Center, we have no plans for further dispositions. Even without a Campus Center sale, as a result of our completed dispositions, we now have ample capital to run and grow our business. This includes funding our exceptional organic as well as select value-creation opportunities.

We are keenly aware of a disconnect between public and private market valuations, and that our stock continues to trade at a significant discount to NAV. As such, we continue to practically evaluate the potential repurchase of our stock pursuant to a previously obtained board authorization of up to $250 million.

I want to thank everyone at Hudson Pacific, especially for the senior management team for their hard work this quarter and every quarter. Hudson Pacific was recently named one of Los Angeles best places to work. I'm very proud that we have built a phenomenal team at all levels. I view this recognition as a reflection of our collective commitment to fostering an exceptionally innovative, super collaborative, high-lead performance culture through which our employees feel valued.

To everyone on the call, we appreciate your support. And operator, let's open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.

ADAM JOEL GABALSKI, RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Adam Gabalski on for Vikram. I was just hoping you could walk through some of the biggest puts and takes that are going to be impacting same-store growth numbers in 2019.

ARTHUR X. SUAZO: Well, we haven't provided 2019 guidance so it's going to be a bit tricky to really try to highlight what the bigger inputs are on the same-store. Rather than try to -- because we didn't really come with a list of items for this, for purposes of this call, why don't we try to tackle that one either at a later point in time or maybe in connection with providing that guidance.

ADAM JOEL GABALSKI: Got you. Got you. And then another one. Can you just walk through how you guys are thinking about the potential regulatory impacts of the Costa-Hawkins vote and what that could ultimately mean for the office market?

ARTHUR X. SUAZO: Yes. I mean, we're tracking it. I think -- I don't know if you listened to Douglas Emmett's call, but I think their -- we view it exactly the same they do. Look, it's hard to say what the impact is, but I think -- I guess, I just would encourage you to listen to their commentary on it, that kind of lines up with our commentary. As you know we're not directly affected by multifamily, but we're monitoring it and sort of line up with their point of view around it.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.

MICHAEL BILERMAN, MD AND HEAD OF THE US REAL ESTATE AND LODGING RESEARCH, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Victor, I appreciated your comments at the end that you're keenly aware of the disconnect between public and private. I think relative to consensus NAV, HPP is trading at a 30% discount. The urban CBD office landlords, as a whole, are at 20%. So your discount is certainly much wider than your peer set, but clearly there's an industry issue as well going on. And you said you're going to be proactively -- you're looking at share buyback as an alternative, I guess, why haven't that been done to date? Why haven't you been buying stock the whole way through?

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Well, first of all, as you know there's blackout periods. And so you can't buy stock in the blackout periods. And as of, I believe, this Tuesday or Wednesday, we will be able to purchase stock if we believe that it represents compelling value, which we currently do, and we believe that the purchases will be in the open market starting next week. That's what we're anticipating. Unfortunately, you can't wake up and say we're going to buy stock because 45 days of every quarter, you can't. And so -- and then there's other compelling issues that take place with us knowing that we are buying assets or we're doing major leases or we're selling assets that are materially -- assets that can or cannot impinge us. But rest assured we've got, as I said, about $0.25 billion approved. But we have a boarding meeting in the first week of December, we will revisit that number. And if it needs for us to go higher, then we will. But we may make purchases in the open market and we believe that our stock represents compelling value, which it currently does.

MICHAEL BILERMAN: And then you're part of a small minority of REIT CEOs who have sold their companies and are back in the public domain. A small attractive group of guys have done that. So I guess, how do you put, outside of just buying your stock, how do you sort of put that into context knowing that you have sold the company before and the private market is extraordinarily active, the lending market is extraordinarily active, houses are trading at pretty compelling values on a per square foot in your markets? So I guess how do -- when you stepped back strategically, does that become an option for you at all?

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Well, listen, it's clear and evident by my comments in our company's position that we will always look at a fiduciary obligation. And the fact that we're in the best markets in the country and our performance is well in excess of the majority of our peer group from an operating standpoint, from a future growth standpoint and from a valuation standpoint, we are hurting dramatically in the public markets. That does not go unnoticed by this company or by private market investors. And so whether -- what I've done in the past, and that's indicative of the future, is not what we're looking at here. We're looking at what's going to be the best scenario if not a knee-jerk reaction. We performed poorly this year. We're not happy about it. But we are very happy about the operations and about the infrastructure and where our growth prospects are, and I think it will work itself out.

MICHAEL BILERMAN: Do you -- I mean, for those that don't know, if you take us back to 2005 when you sold the company to GE, what were the situations around that time period that led you to that decision versus where you sit today with HPP?

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: It was a completely different company at that time. Our portfolio was much a different makeup. The marketplace was a lot re-executing in '06 and the marketplace was a lot more active from a capital standpoint in the public markets than it is currently today. We just couldn't compete with the private market acquisitions at that time and we couldn't -- we didn't have access to any capital. Our balance sheet was constrained much more differently and prospectively than it is today. And yet, we were approached by multiple private market guys who were interested in the value of our company going forward. But that process was not, as I said, a short-term process. None of these processes are. It took some time to execute.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Daniel Santos with Sandler O'Neill.

DANIEL SANTOS, VP, SANDLER O'NEILL + PARTNERS, L.P., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just the first one is given the recent sell-off in tech, has that had any impact on the mood and the outlook of the tenants you're discussing and maybe any impact on your leasing discussions?

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Absolutely 0%. I think you saw by our prepared remarks and by Art's discussion as well, we've never had a better leasing quarter. And the preponderance of that has been in the Valley in San Francisco and the media and tech business has been growing at great levels. It's had no impact on our valuation, our leasing comments and the structure of leases. And currently, I think Art will tell you that our pipelines, equally what it was 1 year ago, what it was 6 months ago, what it was 3 months ago.

DANIEL SANTOS: Great. That's helpful. And then, next, on San Francisco. Just given the imbalance, are you seeing more activity in the Peninsula or East Bay? Or are you seeing -- or maybe seeing some of those tenants go to different markets like Seattle or LA.

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Well, San Francisco today has about, I think, 3-plus million square feet of assets under construction delivering somewhere between now and 2022. And of those 3 million square feet, I think 92% is pre-leased. And all the recently delivered projects in that marketplace is 99%. So it's not like they're leaving San Francisco, there's just nowhere to go in San Francisco right now. And the deals that we are doing, have done and about to announce, are all at high watermarks when it comes to leasing. I do think that we've seen the Peninsula being a massive benefactor of that on the large tenant strategies, and we've commented on that all the way through. The numbers are very compelling. The rental rate growth in the Valley is on a positive basis year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. They're not as high, obviously, as the city which is almost approaching double digits, but you're seeing an impact on that basis. I do think that the comments around the blitz and tech, all of a sudden people get very nervous about what's changing. Just because the valuations may or may not shift to some of these tech companies, doesn't mean they're laying off people. Quite frankly, I think by the signs of growth in other areas like Seattle, which we're seeing or here in Los Angeles, is a positive momentum story around tech companies that can't grow in the city anymore. And so we take that as a positive sign and not a negative sign.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

JAMES COLIN FELDMAN, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR US OFFICE AND INDUSTRIAL REIT ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I know you guys give a lot of good information on 4Q '18 and full year '19 leasing progress. Can you talk about some of the known move outs that are coming? Or is there a certain percentage we should be thinking about that will be vacating through the end of '19?

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Well, I'll just start off with the global. And the","n Art can just sort of dig in a little bit, and he and Derric are sitting right beside me so they can talk about it a little bit. But as we commented on our prepared remarks, Jamie, I mean we -- we're basically baked and done for 50% of '19's move outs right now. And as I said, 35% of next year is already renewed and the remaining 20-plus percent is being backfilled. So we're well on our way at mark-to-market numbers that are pretty impressive. Some of that year-end -- some of it is year-end, and we do know that -- Stanford Health, as an example, is moving out. And we do know that we're dealing at the year with Saatchi & Saatchi, which we're in negotiations with right now for -- but they're end of the year, and we're confident on that. I think Technicolor is the same thing. We're confident that we're going to renew those guys. So there's a lot of positive trends right now, but if you want to talk specifics about a few tenants, Art?

ARTHUR X. SUAZO: Sure. Hi, Jamie. Yes, so as Victor touched on, the larger tenants -- let's just say the largest 10 tenants, we've got 1 known vacate in the largest 10, that's Stanford. We've got the largest, which is Capital One, as you're well aware, that's 133,000 square feet, we've already backfilled 80. We're working on kind of the last large floor. So we should have good news on that very, very soon. And one deal is in discussion, so of the top 10, we've got 8 spoken for, 1 in discussions and 1 in negotiations so...

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: One move out.

ARTHUR X. SUAZO: And one move out with Stanford. All of that kind of totals up to about 55% coverage for all of next year, and we feel pretty good about that right now.

JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Okay. So you're saying those 10 leases are 55% of the expirations?

ARTHUR X. SUAZO: No. I'm saying we've got coverage on 55% of the total -- kind of the total universe of expirations, which is about $1.3 million for next year.

JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Okay. So I guess those 10 leases, what does that add up to?

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: On a percentage of expirations.

ARTHUR X. SUAZO: Yes. That's about 40% or about 50 -- 50% of it. Those are just the top 10.

JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Yes. No, I know. Okay. That's very helpful. And then, I guess, for Mark. You guys mentioned the potential share buybacks. Can you just talk us through just the capital spending and timing, I guess, through '19 if you can or even longer, with -- given some of the projects you have. Just how should we be thinking about -- I know Victor had mentioned you're kind of set with your capital needs for now, but how do we think about how the money is going to be flowing out and timing?

MARK T. LAMMAS: Sure. So if you take where we left off on third quarter, the balance sheet information in the press release and bring it forward for the Ferry buy, we're now at, call it, $650 million -- just shy of $650 million of capital availability. And that assumes no asset sales or anything like that. So for example, if we did sell Campus Center, that would obviously increase that availability. And then you forecasted through the end of 2020, so more than 2 years from now, where the spend against that, net of cash flow available, factoring in all capital requirements, dividends and everything, is in the $470 range. So your net capital availability is somewhere north of $170 million of net availability after all known spend for more than 2 years from now. By the time we get to 2021, there's some remaining spend, take for example on Westside Pavilion, but you're also turning wildly net cash flow positive, right, because now things like EPIC and other developments are fully online. And so you're actually generating more cash flow than what your net capital requirements are associated with anything that has ongoing spend on it. So you have more than enough capital availability to satisfy all known capital requirements well through 2020 and beyond and room enough to do things like a share repurchase or even incremental acquisition. And again, that's all assuming there's no further asset sales or anything.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Rich Anderson with Mizuho.

RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON, MD, MIZUHO SECURITIES USA LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So a question for anyone in the room. What do you view as sort of a normal tenant retention rate for the company on a go-forward basis given all the moving parts that you've had to this point and how might that compare to -- how might that perspective on the future compare to what has happened in the last few years with your company?

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Well, Rich, so I mean, on average, we have vacillated much on this. In terms of tenants that we retained, it's been on the average in the low to mid-70s across the board. Now there are exceptions to that because they couldn't accommodate growth. We've had a massive growth portfolio of tenants that have gone from small to midsize to large sizes, and so they've moved out. So we couldn't accommodate their growth prospects, but I don't think it's really changed much more than 70%. We don't really envision it. I mean the numbers we're looking for this year and the numbers we're looking for next year is going to be the same. The no move outs, as Art and Mark have commented on a regular occurrence, are tenants that either can't be accommodated in our portfolio for the most part or are -- they're not downsizing their growth.

RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON: Okay. That's clear. Got it. When I -- when we look at sort of -- I know you're not giving '19 guidance, but there is quite a wide range of estimates out there. Perhaps some misunderstandings about the implication of disposition, the timing factors around leasing, et cetera. And so I know you're not giving guidance, but perhaps you can comment on the repeatability of the same-store growth profile of the office segment, 5% for 2018. Would you call that a repeatable level or is it inflated or deflated for one reason or another in terms of what we could see from a recurring standpoint?

MARK T. LAMMAS: Yes. A couple of things on that. If you go back to beginning of this year, we set our midpoint guidance on office same-store in the mid-3s. And we've had sort of ongoing success, mostly on the leasing front, and it's slowly crept up to the current midpoint of 5. And so when you say repeatable, I think it's important to kind of understand that it's kind of move towards that 5 point which is, obviously, considerably higher than kind of our peers' mid-points. Having said that, and again I think we are dangerously strained in the kind of key metric to a number that -- to a guidance number. But in any event, look, I think some of the same dynamics that has under -- that are underlining, the 5% midpoint are still in play in '19 with 11-ish or so percent of the square footage rolling in '19. The level of coverage that we mentioned, both in terms of either backfilled or deals in process of 55%, a mark-to-market against that coming in approaching 20%, it seems possible that we could be kind of industry levels. We might get as close to a 5% same-store cash NOI growth. But you know, we haven't finalized the number yet, but I think some of the same dynamics are at play.

RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON: That's great color. And then last to Victor. When you compare what you're doing in L.A. with the studio and the Arts District and all those sort of unique things with Netflix, with San Francisco and the big roll ups and the opportunities that are there, where do you see the bigger opportunity on a go-forward basis for Hudson Pacific? Would you call them different, but equally exciting? Or is one sort of capturing your imagination more than the other?

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Well, it's sort of a tougher question to sort of pinpoint on a single thing. In San Francisco, what we are seeing and then what we have available, unfortunately, is not the same. Other than the close to 40% mark-to-market, we're going to have on Ferry, and we got lots of activity in that space in the office, we're virtually leased in San Francisco right now. I think we're 97% leased of our stabilized stuff right now, and we're about to announce a couple of larger deals that we're going to be done. Here, I do think that in Los Angeles, we have a lot of opportunity in a marketplace that is on the upswing. And so if you're asking for, ""the excitement level,"" right, we've talked about -- we've got potential future development of over 1 million square feet. We've got another 100,000-square-foot-plus project that we're just coming out of the ground on. In Harlow, we've got a very exciting project with lots of activity on single-tenant users at West Side Pavilion. And we're seeing rental rate growth unlike we've seen in the last 2 or 3 years in West Los Angeles around the media and tech-related businesses. So I think if you're asking for ""the excitement level,"" you have to sort of say the growth potentials and the excitement are going to be here in Los Angeles for Hudson in the near future.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird.

DAVID BRYAN RODGERS, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Victor, I wanted to just start with you in terms of what -- are you seeing more and more opportunities to add to the value-add pipeline development or redevelopment adding new buildings? Because you talked about no asset sales, so I was thinking about funding. And then maybe the second question on that is bringing in the joint venture partner on the Ferry Building. Can you talk a little bit more about the appetite for that, the reason? Was it dilution? Was it just the amount of money, the opportunity was retail, et cetera?

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Yes. So let me say this, Dave, first, on your first point. And I've made the commentary, as has Alex, who's really sort of supported it, the bandwagon in the company. We're seeing less and less transactions that are earmarked for Hudson in all of our markets. And so the transactions that we're seeing are almost uniformly development, redevelopment-related assets. And as a result, that fits right in our sweet spot for returns and yields. And what we're seeing on those assets, I think, we've been surprised on the positive side of what we've developed at and what we've redeveloped at and where we're going to have some metrics around a higher yield than we anticipated going in. And probably a part of that is a little bit about us pre-buying materials and some construction and some of our redevelopment cost and efficiencies, but majority of that is the efficiencies at the tenants market today where rental rates are. And we've tried to relay this message, albeit, I think we've gotten a number of questions and maybe slightly a little bit of push back, is we're not losing deals. And I keep reiterating this point, Dave. We're not losing deals to rental rate. We're losing deals to time frame, accessibility, interest level on companies, but it's not based on rental rate. And clearly, as you can see in the markets, it's absolutely not based on competition because there's very little competition in our markets for the kind of space that we're attracting. So that's all on the positive side and we're going continue to look for these value-added opportunities, and I think the yields are going to be very compelling. To answer your second question, we didn't buy the Ferry Building with the intent to bring in a JV partner. Allianz came to us during the process. We have now 2 JV partners, I guess you would call it 3 if we're referring to Macerich as 1 as well because they contributed their asset into our JV. But 2 capital JV partners, Allianz and CPP, both are very active. When you do a JV, you spend a tremendous amount of time courting each other, documenting and having the relationship. You want to maintain those relationships for more than one deal. We could have done Ferry on our own. We were actually prepared to do it on our own and the relationship just got basically energized to a point where we're saying, hey, let's do more together some maybe on existing stuff and some on future stuff. And so we're very comfortable with our 2 JV partners. They're extremely well capitalized. And sometimes, you got to show them deals in order to maintain those relationships going forward, and I think that's exactly what we did at the Ferry Building. It's an iconic asset. It's got better upside than most people realize and it's got a partner with us now that really wants to do more deals with us.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

LAURA JOY DICKSON, ASSOCIATE, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Laura Dickson here with Craig. So first question is for Art. You made progress on the lease-up portfolio on the quarter. And I was just wondering if you could kind of go -- on Page 23, if we could just look through some of the different assets with the bigger vacancies and you could just go through some of the activity there. I know you mentioned 450 Alaskan and 95 Jackson earlier.

ARTHUR X. SUAZO: Sure. Laura, one second. Let me just hand them the supplemental. Got it. Okay. Let's start in Seattle, right, with 450 Alaskan. We are in leases right now so that's -- for about 55,000 square feet. We move down to San Francisco, we've got cash vault, which is 66,000 square feet, right? That was the repositioning of the BofA cash vault. We are also in leases there for the entirety of that space. We move down -- what?

LAURA JOY DICKSON: Sorry. Which one was BofA cash vault at?

ARTHUR X. SUAZO: 1455 Market.

LAURA JOY DICKSON: Yes, okay.

ARTHUR X. SUAZO: Okay. We move down to Peninsula. We've got vacancy at Metro Center. We've got -- we're really deploying our VSP program in a big way, large-scale and small suites. I want to ground that conversation to Metro Center because we've moved -- we move that asset from 59% leased to 77.5% leased currently over this period -- over a period of time. We have had some move outs, some downsizes that we've been successful with keeping tenants in there, but we probably have another 40,000 square feet in the pipeline now. They are close to LOI. And behind that, probably another 25,000 to 30,000 square feet of real interest. So we feel positive about the momentum we're making over there.

LAURA JOY DICKSON: Great. And then just a follow-up on 1455 Market. I think you said earlier there was a 200% mark-to-market expected on that space? Do you have activity on there?

ARTHUR X. SUAZO: Yes. Yes. If you recall, that was the tenant at subterranean, the first basement. There are 2 basements there, right? It was the first basement space that we've reimagined.

LAURA JOY DICKSON: Is that going to be an office space or...

ARTHUR X. SUAZO: Yes. That's going to be office space.

LAURA JOY DICKSON: Okay. Great. And then just one last question regarding Campus Center sale. If you could just discuss types of the demand you're seeing? I don't know if it's too early, but I'm just curious about any color there.

ALEXANDER VOUVALIDES, CIO, HUDSON PACIFIC PROPERTIES, INC.: This is Alex. So we've launched officially a couple of weeks ago, so it's still early in the process. We are marketing the full sites, so both the 35 acres of industrial land as well as the existing office improvement. So far, we're seeing really good activity from potential buyers that want to take down the entire project. We're seeing good activity from buyers that 1 of the 2 components. We'll probably start getting a better sense of the market and where things are shaking out over the next couple of weeks. So it's still somewhat early, but we're encouraged by the activity so far in the market.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.

BLAINE MATTHEW HECK, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mark, sorry if I missed this. But can you just talk about the decrease in same-store guidance for the studios and what drove that?

MARK T. LAMMAS: Sure. I think, the key thing to understand about it is the difference between the 10.5 midpoint and the current 9 midpoint is actually only $330,000, which is about 1.5% of last year's full year '17 NOI, just to kind of give you a sense of magnitude. But since we guide for the segment separately, we want to just keep you guys kind of tracking with our internal projections even though the dollar impact amount is fairly insignificant. And what's driving it largely are some changes in operating expenses stemming from turning over some vendors like parking and security. That's really the key driver of that small difference in NOI.

BLAINE MATTHEW HECK: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Art, NFL had an early termination, right, on or before, I think, October 4. Obviously, we're past that now. There have been some reports of them moving some of their operations to the new stadium. Does that directly affect you guys? And if so, how are you thinking about the prospect for a backfill there and mark-to-market? Any commentary?

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: I mean, listen, Blaine, if we're talking about 2023, we got a larger list than just NFL. So -- I mean, the stadium is going to be done in '22 or '23. They're not going anywhere between now and then, so we've got 3 to 4 years. There is no -- they're not moving out right now, so that's definitely the case.

ARTHUR X. SUAZO: By the way, Blaine, the early termination deadline isn't October of this year, it's next year. I mean, it doesn't affect what Victor just said in terms of prospects for whatever ends up happening and whether or not we get it back early or not, but we won't know for another year whether or not they exercise the early termination.

OPERATOR: There are no further questions at this time. At this point, I'd like to turn the call back to Victor Coleman for closing comments.

VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Thanks so much for the support and the participation. And I want to, again, reiterate my thanks to the entire Hudson Pacific team. Have a good day.

The developer behind Museum Place, a 1.4 million-square-foot downtown San Jose mixed-use development and Tech Museum expansion, is simplifying the project, shedding the previously planned hotel and residential units in the project.

Plans submitted this week to the city of San Jose show that investor and developer Gary Dillabough, who took over the project from Insight Realty earlier this year, is looking to reconfigure the previously approved tower by increasing the office space from 250,000 square feet to 850,000 square feet on the 2.3-acre site at 180 Park Ave., where Parkside Hall currently sits.

""The reality of the situation is that when you are trying to build a hotel, residential space and office, you can't do all three in a world-class fashion, and our belief is that we want to build a world-class office tower,"" Dillabough told the Business Journal in an interview Thursday morning.

That means the previously planned 184-room Kimpton Hotel and the 306 residential units that San Jose-based Insight Realty had gotten approved by the city last year would be no more. The project is now estimated to rise to about 19 stories - down from the currently approved 24 stories - and would still include parking and between 15,000 square feet and 20,000 square feet of retail space on the ground level.

Dillabough, who has become a major property owner in Downtown San Jose over the last year-and-a-half after setting off on a buying spree in the area, says he is still interested in hotel and residential projects in the city, just not at Museum Place.

""We still think the city needs housing and hotel uses, but we think they would be better in standalone buildings,"" he said.

Downtown San Jose boosters and real estate experts say the change is welcome in an area where office development proposals and visions for redevelopment are plenty, but few have actually risen in the last decade.

Across the street from Museum Place, for instance, Jay Paul Co. has purchased the approximately 600,000-square-foot, block-long mixed-use campus known as CityView Plaza, where the San Francisco-based developer is planning a massive tear-down and redevelopment.

Though the company hasn't yet submitted plans to the city, it has started shutting down campus amenities and real estate insiders say they're expecting to see Jay Paul Co. come forward with plans for a corporate campus on the site that would span at least 2 million square feet in size.

Next to the Museum Place project, San Jose developer JP Dinapoli Cos. has proposed a 20-story tower with 740,000 square feet of office space. Also nearby, Adobe Systems is planning to build a fourth office tower in San Jose, which will allow the tech giant to double its employee count in downtown.

Prolific devleoper, The Sobrato Organization last month also submitted plans for a more than 600,000-square-foot tower project in downtown next to the Fairmont Hotel on a site known as Block 8.

Meanwhile, Mountain View-based search engine giant Google is buying up huge swaths of real estate less than a mile away with the hopes of building a new tech campus that could span up to 8 million square feet in size.

In all, more than 5 million square feet of office space has been formally proposed in and around the downtown core, according to Business Journal research. When counting in Jay Paul's potential CityView redevelopment and Alphabet-owned Google's development dreams near Diridon Transit Station, that number skyrockets to somewhere around 15 million square feet of potential new office space in the area.

But even with all of those plans, the only new office building currently under construction is The Sobrato Organization's final phase of its River Corporate Center at 353 Julian St. Cupertino-based Sobrato leased that 190,000-square-foot building on the edge of downtown to Santa Clara County before construction began.

""For being a downtown, we are so underserved by our office space totals,"" said Scott Knies, executive director of the San Jose Downtown Association. ""We have a very anemic total Class A office population for a downtown of our size and we need more jobs. Obviously for the city of San Jose in general this is the best place to put them.""

Dillabough agrees, and said he is aiming to bring more ""vibrant companies"" to downtown San Jose.

""We have had a number of conversations with a handful of tenants that we think are looking for that size of footprint,"" he said, though he noted there was no specific tenant in tow for Museum Place. ""What we are building towards is what tech companies are looking for.""

But even outside the general enthusiasm for new downtown office space, simplifying the uses at Museum Place makes sense, said Mark Ritchie, president of Ritchie Commercial Inc. and a downtown San Jose real estate guru who has long been an advocate for more office space to rise in the downtown core.

""I think those types of stacked mixed-use projects, they are so expensive to blend the uses on top of each other and downtown San Jose is such a high-risk development model that I don't blame him for switching.""

Indeed, Dillabough acknowledged Thursday that shifting the project to be almost entirely office space does make the financing pitch a little easier: ""I do think it is true that it is a much larger group of people that are interesting in financing something that would be all office or all residential or all hotel,"" he said.

Dillabough is aiming to begin moving around utilities on the site starting in the middle of next year, and beginning construction on the building immediately after that. He anticipates an approximately 24-month construction schedule. Steinberg Hart is the architect and Level 10 Construction is the general contractor.

HIGHLIGHT:еКPotentially 1,800 to 2,000 employees of Google or its owner, Alphabet, could work in the large office campus on North First Street that the company has bought for $154.5 million in an all-cash purchase.

SAN JOSE  Google has grabbed two big office buildings in north San Jose, an unexpected property purchase that underscores the search giants wide-ranging interest in the Bay Areas largest city.

Potentially 1,800 to 2,000 employees of Google or its owner, Alphabet, could work in the large office campus on North First Street that the company has bought in an all-cash purchase.

We see substantial vacancies and opportunities for expansion in north San Jose, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said Wednesday in an interview. Its good to see Google and other companies starting to absorb that space.

Mountain View-based Google has jumped into downtown San Jose over the last two years with plans for a transit-oriented community of office buildings, homes, restaurants, shops and open spaces where the search giant could employ 15,000 to 20,000 workers.

Now it appears that Google is widening its areas of interest in north San Jose with the acquisition of the corporate campus, which consists of a pair of big, curving office buildings.

An investment by Google is probably going to be a good investment for any city, said Bob Staedler, principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a land use planning and consultancy group.

Google paidеК$154.5 million for the two buildings at 4300 N. First St. and 4400 N. First St., according to Santa Clara County property documents filed on Oct. 30.

The buildings total 377,000 square feet, according to a marketing sign in front of the offices.

Google, through a spokeswoman, confirmed the acquisition but didnt discuss the situation in detail on Wednesday.

This isnt Googles first major foray into north San Jose.еКIn January, Google paid

$117.3 million for three large warehouses in the Midpoint@237 industrial complex, just a few hundred yards away from the two-building campus that the tech titan has just purchased.

Google also has workers in some small offices further south near North First Street and East Trimble Road.

North San Jose is a great market, Staedler said. You have a lot of companies and investors that are looking in that area.

The office complex that Google has bought has been leased to major tech companies, including IBM and Harmonic. Harmonic still occupies space in the 4300 N. First St. building.

We are very excited about Googles investment in north San Jose, said Nanci Klein, San Joses director of real estate and assistant director of economic development. Its great to see that Google continues to make north San Jose stronger in addition to the downtown.

North San Jose appears to be front and center in the next wave of corporate and tech expansions in Silicon Valley.

With Sunnyvale and Santa Clara, most of the quality space is leased which means north San Jose is going to get more and more activity, said Dave Sandlin, an executive vice president with Colliers International, a commercial realty firm. North San Jose is the main location where you can find these large blocks of top-quality office space. There are a lot of sites getting interest.

Adding to the attraction in the region: BART stations that could go online in the coming months in Milpitas and northeast San Joses Berryessa district.

Having transit being upgraded nearby really does help that area, Sandlin said. You can have shuttle buses for the last mile to connect to both those stations.",310,Nicholas Ibarra,31-Oct-18,Tech Pioneer Jaron Lanier: Social Media Is Destroying Democracy,818,The Mercury News (california),,"Tech Pioneer Jaron Lanier: Social Media Is Destroying Democracy

HIGHLIGHT:еКA renowned computer scientist, thinker and author, Jaron Lanier has been sounding the alarm about the supposed perils of social media for more than a decade

SANTA CRUZ - Social media is destroying Democracy.

Or so goes the punchline to tech pioneer Jaron Lanier's visit to Santa Cruz on Monday, where Lanier - whose varied career includes coining the term ""virtual reality"" and earning a spot on Time Magazine's 2010 list of the world's 100 most influential people - met with UC Santa Cruz students and delivered an evening lecture.

A renowned computer scientist, thinker and author, Lanier has been sounding the alarm about the supposed perils of social media for more than a decade, warning that the ad-revenue-driven, attention-hoarding algorithms of companies such as Facebook and Twitter are inherently structured to trigger a fight-or-flight response, and claiming the platforms could threaten the stability of modern society itself.

But it's only recently, as current events provide frequent fodder for Lanier's case, that an audience beyond the hills of Silicon Valley has perked up its ears.

""I'm really concerned Facebook is going to kill all the democratic governments before we have a chance to regulate it,"" Lanier told an audience of freshmen from UCSC's College Scholars honor program.

The students had just finished reading Lanier's newest book, ""Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,"" as part of their coursework and were invited to ask its author questions directly.

Lanier's visit, which kicked off a year of ""Data and Democracy"" programming at the UCSC Humanities institute, could hardly have been better timed to underscore his central claim.

In the U.S, the past week has seen wave of partisan and hate-fueled violence with bombs mailed to prominent Democrats, shots fired into a Florida GOP headquarters and 11 people killed in a massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue.

And on Sunday, Brazil elected far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro to the presidency, becoming the latest Democratic nation to lurch toward nationalism amid an increasingly vitriolic and polarized political climate.

The growing list of nations grappling with populist are culturally and politically diverse, Lanier said. ""But the one thing they all have in common, is this recent - relatively recent - arrival of social media, followed by this wave of nasty, irritable politics coming to the fore all at once.""

Before answering questions and laying out what he sees as a potential path forward, Lanier reflected on a time in his teenage years when he ""bummed through"" Santa Cruz as a young hippie.

Clad in Birkenstocks and sporting long dreadlocks, Lanier's anecdote drew few raised eyebrows.

Lanier's conclusion, however - that society would be best served if many of us deleted our social media accounts - did.

Kora Fortun, a freshman linguistics and math major, told Lanier that she agrees with many of his premises but sees a different path forward.

""I see more hope in a new generation of social media users being aware and thus maintaining some control of the platforms we use,"" Fortun said.

Lanier responded that he ""loved the idea"" of a population with the wisdom to avoid being herded by the algorithms, but he doesn't believe it's possible. ""It's all this algorithmic adaptive process that keeps trying a million experiments on populations of millions of people until it finds what works,"" he said. ""Given that that's the way the system operates in many cases, I respectfully have to inform you that you have no hope of being self-aware about this.""

Later Monday, Lanier fleshed out his thesis in more detail as he delivered the 2018 Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture, drawing a narrative of tech companies selling users' data and attention as their true product in order to meet an expectation that web services should be free.

""We've created a world in which anytime two people connect online it's financed by a third person who believes they can manipulate the first two,"" Lanier said.

Feeding the cycle, Lanier claimed, is an addictive tendency on behalf of social media users that he compared to gambling or cigarette smoking.

And his proposed solution is designed to account for that addictive tendency: If enough social media users can break away from dependency, Lanier claimed, they could serve as an unbiased base of advocates to reform the system - as, in his telling, happened with tobacco legislation.

Search giant Google, which has been working for more than a year on a potential transit-oriented urban campus in downtown San Jose, has purchased two large office buildings in North San Jose for $154.5 million, according to the Mercury News.

The properties at 4300 and 4400 North First St., total 377,000 square feet, the publication reported, citing marketing materials. That means the deal works out to nearly $410 per square foot for the office space. The building at 4400 N. First St. was recently renovated and won the Silicon Valley Business Journal's ""Amenities Project of the Year"" award in September.

Google, the online search subsidiary of Mountain View-based Alphabet Inc., confirmed the transaction to the Mercury News but didn't provide further comment on the purchases. The property's former owner, The Carlyle Group - which originally purchased the campus in 2007 - commissioned architecture firm Nelson, HMH Engineers and South Bay Construction to revamp the building. The landscape architect was Jackson Derler. That work wrapped up around the end of 2017.

The campus has long been partially occupied. Harmonic, a video telecommunications developer and supplier, leases the property at 4300 N. First St., but that lease is slated to end in 2020, according to property database website, Compstak.

Google's San Jose property buys have thus far focused on the edges of downtown, around the Diridon transit station, where the company has outlined a broad vision for an urban campus that could span as large as 8 million square feet and host up to 20,000 workers.

But the company has made purchases on San Jose's north side before. As the Business Journal first reported earlier this year, Google spent $117.25 million on three industrial buildings totaling more than 563,000 square feet in the Midpoint development in North San Jose's Alviso district. The company's plans for those properties and the North First Street buildings remain unclear.

While vacancy rates in North San Jose remain high, the area is heating up and several developers and large tenants have recently placed bigger bets on the area. A handful of pioneering mainstays have long called San Jose's north side home - including PayPal Holdings and Cisco Systems - but recently other big names have started zooming in on the area.

Among the newest corporate announcements are Micron Technology,еКwhich is taking over the onetime Brocade Communications campus, and Bloom Energy, which is moving its headquarters to the north side from Sunnyvale. Meanwhile, eBay is in the process ofеКexpanding a campus along North First StreetеКwhile Hewlett Packard EnterpriseеКCo. prepares to move from its flashy Palo Alto offices to North San Jose's Alviso district.

Microsoft Corp. is also moving forward on aеКnew industrial and data center campusеКafter buying nearly 65 acres in North San Jose in late 2017.

North San Jose is ""on the cusp"" of flourishing into something bigger,еКChris Burton, assistant to the city manager and senior business development manager for the city of San Jose, told the Business Journal earlier this year: ""It feels like there are things happening and peoples' perception of the place is changing,"" he said.

A long time teacher of C-FB ISD, Adam Toy has wore many hats in the district. His latest role is principal at DeWitt Perry Middle School. Coming from a family of educators, Toy decided he wanted a career in the classroom. In honor of national principal's month, Toy and many other C-FB ISD principals have been recognized for their leadership. When not in school, Toy loves to spend time with his family and travel.

How long have been in education?

This is my 20th year in Carrollton-Farmers Branch. I started teaching in 1999. I taught elementary music in the spring after I graduated from Abilene Christian University and then began my teaching career in the fall of 1999 in the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District. I taught choir at R.L. Turner and Ranchview High School. I then went into school administration as an assistant principal at DeWitt Perry and R.L. Turner High School, associate principal at Ranchview and now principal at DeWitt Perry Middle School, So, yes, I've come full circle twice at three different campuses.

What led you to pursue a career in education?

I come from a family of educators. My mother taught sixth grade reading and social studies most of her career in the same classroom in the same school. My grandmother was an educator as well. But that's not my sole reason. I had absolutely fantastic teachers growing up who held me accountable, let me explore information rather than force it on me and cared enough about me to not let me fail. By my junior year in high school, I had a pretty good idea I wanted to work in schools and give back just like my great teachers did.

What do you enjoy about being a principal?

My favorite part of the day is standing in the foyer in the morning before school and greeting kids and parents as they come in. I think we all feel better, have more confidence and will work harder if we know we have someone on our side, rain or shine. I also enjoy walking the halls and chatting with our teachers (who lead amazing lives in the classroom and out). I enjoy hearing about their weekends, family updates and stories about their kids. It reminds me of just how much of a family we are at DeWitt Perry. We have to band together. It takes all of us, working together, standing beside each other, to support our kids and make their future bright.

What are some challenges you face as principal?

I think educational funding at the state level is our main concern as principals and educators. Our school district does an amazing job of allocating resources to the benefit of each child in our school district. We also pay our teachers very well. However, that money only goes so far and often forces choices that revolve around state and federal budgets rather than what's best for students.

As principal, what gets the bulk of your attention during a typical week?

Our number one priority is the safety and security of our students and teachers. I walk the halls every morning before school and greet students and parents. I also walk the hallways every passing period to greet students and teachers but also to get a pulse for the building. Second, I spend a lot of time in classrooms mentoring and coaching teachers. We have a culture of feedback and coaching among our teachers at DeWitt Perry. They are constantly trying to get better at their craft, and I spend a lot of time observing and then meeting to follow up. It's almost never evaluative, but almost always in a coaching type scenario. Finally, like most principals, I can get sucked into the black hole of meetings for various things like administrative meetings, leadership meetings, campus improvement council, etc. However, I try to limit those as much as possible with short, pertinent agendas. No one likes meeting just for the sake of meeting, right?

What do you like to do in your free time?

I have a wife and two kids and so we try to do things together as a family. We are very involved in our church. We like to spend time outdoors. And we like to travel even if it's just for a weekend.

What has been your favorite family vacation?

I don't know if I could pick one. We do travel a lot and love exploring new places. However, this past summer I had the opportunity to visit the Google Campus in San Jose, California for training. When the training was over, my wife flew out and we traveled the coast of California stopping in Monterey and Carmel. In all of my travels, I think the coast along that area is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in person. It was amazing.

What's another language you would like to be fluent in?

Spanish, although I'm trying!

Who was your favorite teacher in school? Why?

I had so many. I would probably say Mrs. Miller, my first grade teacher. She was so nice but relentless in reminding me to tie my shoes, walk in a straight line, try my hardest and most importantly making me feel that I was smart enough to accomplish anything. When I graduated from high school, and then from college, I got a letter in the mail from Mrs. Miller each time with some of my first grade work (that she had kept) and a note that she was happy for me and proud of what I had accomplished. True story. She was an amazing woman.

What accomplishment are you most proud of?

I think first and foremost, I'm most proud of my family, my marriage and their love (tolerance sometimes) for me as a dad and husband. A very close second is being the principal at DeWitt Perry Middle School. I'll be honest that I teared up in the superintendent's office when I was offered the position. This school has so much history, legacy and positive vibes that I was so thrilled and honored to be invited back. It's a giant task, and I couldn't do it by myself, but I'm very proud to be serving the community here on the hill.

If you could have dinner with anyone from history, who would you choose?

Jesus

What's the best piece of advice you've received?

Abraham Lincoln was known for many things. What is a little less known is that much of his success came from sitting down with those who disagreed with him the most. He broke bread with them, had conversation without insult, and finally, he came to a decision on important issues that he believed in that were also in the best interest of all involved. I think many can learn from his example. Just because we disagree, it doesn't mean we can't get along as we fight together for the greater good.",313,,26-Oct-18,Hff Concludes $104m Sale Of Meridian At Midtown In San Jose,243,Entertainment Close-up,,"Hff Concludes $104m Sale Of Meridian At Midtown In San Jose

HFF reported the $104 million sale of Meridian at Midtown, a 218-unit luxury apartment community with approximately 14,000 square feet of ground-floor retail in San Jose, Calif.

According to a release, the HFF team marketed the property on behalf of the seller, Republic Urban Properties, and procured the buyer.

Meridian at Midtown is situated at 1432 W. San Carlos Street less than one mile west of downtown and just north of Interstate 280. The property's Midtown location has earned it a Walk Score of 90. Built in 2015, the mid-rise property offers a range of amenities, including three fitness centers, conference rooms, a resort-style pool with cabanas, community lounge space, dog park, outdoor courtyard, playground and ground-floor retail amenities such as The Breakfast Club and Starbucks. Residential units include a variety of studio, one- and two-bedroom configurations averaging 875 square feet each.

The HFF investment advisory team representing the seller included managing director Scott Bales, director Peter Yorck and analyst Eric Bet.

""Meridian at Midtown's central location is within a mile of Google's proposed campus and the Diridon Station development, which will dramatically shift the core of downtown San Jose closer to Midtown and allow the property to continue to experience tremendous rent growth far into the future,"" Bales said.

Schuetze; Adam Satariano Contributed Reporting From,26-Oct-18,Google Retreats From Berlin Plan Opposed By Local Groups,1007,The New York Times,Section ; Column 0; Foreign Desk,"Google Retreats From Berlin Plan Opposed By Local Groups

BERLIN -- What Google wants, Google usually gets, but in Berlin's Kreuzberg neighborhood, residents have won a battle against the internet giant, which backed away from a project in the face of local opposition.

Google had planned to convert an old electric company building in Kreuzberg into an incubator for tech start-ups, the kind of development that could have altered the fabric of the funky, multicultural area.

Instead, the company announced on Wednesday that after sinking millions of dollars into the project, it will make the space available, free of charge, to nonprofit social service and local advocacy groups -- a move its adversaries welcomed.

The decision handed a surprise victory to anti-gentrification groups who had protested Google's plan, but some city officials saw it as a lost economic opportunity and a stain on Berlin's vaunted tech-friendly reputation.

Kreuzberg has long been one of the most affordable areas of Berlin, making it a haven for students, immigrants, artists and activists, a hub of culture, night life and left-wing politics. But in a pattern repeated in similar neighborhoods in many of the world's wealthiest cities, affluent people have moved in, too, in recent years, bringing with them the social tensions of gentrification.

''They push out the people who were here before,'' said Achim Koppitsch, 60, who runs a vinyl record store in Kreuzberg. ''You can't find any more cool places -- instead you get hipster cafes that roast their own beans.''

Residents opposed to the Kreuzberg project worried about tech salaries driving up rents in a neighborhood already dotted with new restaurants that local residents cannot afford. But reasons for the opposition went beyond gentrification: Some people were opposed to Google because of its data collection and tax avoidance practices.

Activist groups cropped up with names (those that are printable) like No Google Campus, Counter Campus, Google Campus & Co Prevent, with ideologies ranging from neighborhood activism to anarchy.

''Because it was Google, it was always bigger than just an anti-gentrification fight,'' said Konstantin Sergiou, a neighborhood activist who worked against the project. ''We were lucky.''

The activists organized protest rallies, community discussions and, last month, even a short-lived occupation of the site. Kalabal!k, an organization and library devoted to anarchism, hosted bimonthly information sessions. At one event held at SO36, a venerated local nightclub, an activist from San Francisco talked about how the spread -- and wealth -- of Google and other tech companies had transformed her city.

Local resistance to such projects is fairly common. Google's parent company, Alphabet, has faced opposition in Toronto, where it plans to redevelop a section of waterfront, and a Google plan to overhaul an area of San Jose, Calif., has faced criticism.

But cities often see the gentrification that comes with an influx of tech workers as a good problem to have, and they compete with one another to attract big companies. Amazon's plans to open a second headquarters drew more than 200 bids.

In Berlin's city government, opinion is split.

Sebastian Czaja, the head of the pro-business Federal Democrats faction in Berlin's House of Representatives, said that Google's retreat will discourage other companies from settling in the city, which bills itself as the start-up capital of Europe.

''Even if the new use of the venue is welcome, the message to all future companies and investors is fatal: Do not come to Berlin, certainly not to Kreuzberg,'' he said in a statement.

Progressive politicians lauded Google for its decision to focus on social services, charities and neighborhood groups.

''There is a lot of potential for solving societal challenges,'' said Ramona Pop of the Greens, the city senator responsible for the economy, in a statement praising Google's announcement.

Mr. Koppitsch's record store, across the street from the Google site, is typical of the old Kreuzberg, an informal community center where people come to chat and browse through the 10,000 discs.

''I think it's a very positive turn of events, and doing something social is much in tune with what Kreuzberg is about,'' he said.

Ulrike Ebeling, 46, of GIZ, a corporation that works with the government in international aid and development, says she sees herself as a recently arrived gentrifier. Doing her wash in a Kreuzberg laundromat, she said she understood the local groups' arguments, but was not sure Google's withdrawal was good for the city.

''I think it would be good for a capital to have some big employers, not just the big stodgy government as an employer,'' she said. ''But does it have to be in Kreuzberg? I don't know.''

Google, which first announced plans in late 2016 to open a 32,000-square-foot start-up campus, said this week that it had taken note of the protests, but took pains to counter the idea that it had been pressured into changing its plans. An incubator specifically for start-ups was no longer as needed as it was two years ago, the company said.

''From the beginning, our goal with the campus was not only to create a space for start-ups, but also to open the space up to social organizations,'' Rowan Barnett, the head of Google for start-ups in Germany, said in a statement.

Google said it will complete renovations of the building by next spring and then turn the space over to Betterplace, a nonprofit that enables online charitable fund-raising, and Karuna, a nonprofit that combats child homelessness and drug abuse. Betterplace will be in charge of deciding what groups will be invited to move into the building, which includes work spaces, conference rooms and a stage.

JМ¦rg Richert, the founder of Karuna -- which, among other things, has created an app that gives homeless youths access to help around the clock -- said the intersection between new technology and social work has enormous potential.

''But to do it, you need friends like Google on your side,'' he said.",315,Janice Bitters,24-Oct-18,"Exclusive: Micro Focus To Leave Sunnyvale, Move To 114k Square Feet In Santa",809,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Exclusive: Micro Focus To Leave Sunnyvale, Move To 114k Square Feet In Santa

Micro Focus has leased nearly 113,000 square feet in Santa Clara as it prepares to move out of its existing Sunnyvale offices in Moffett Park, sources with knowledge of the transaction have told the Business Journal.

The software and information technology business is slated to move into the third and fourth floors at 4555 Great America Parkway, one of two office buildings part of the Towers at Great America campus.

The move comes months after the Business Journal reported that Amazon.com leased Micro Focus's longtime offices in developer Jay Paul Co.'s Moffett Towers development at 1140 and 1160 Enterprise Way. Amazon will take over 385,000 square feet of office space in the Class A office complex while Micro Focus follows other big tech companies that have begun to move or expand southward in the Valley, where office space tends to be less scarce and leasing costs are often lower.

Even as tech giants like Amazon, Google and Apple Inc. continue to grow their existing footprints along the Peninsula, they're starting to scoop up significant amounts of space in Santa Clara and neighboring cities.

Last year, Amazon subleased more than 160,000 square feet at Irvine Co.'s now fully leased Santa Clara Square while Google started buying up huge portions of San Jose's downtown for a potential new mixed-use campus as the Alphabet-owned search engine giant looks for more room to grow in the Bay Area.

Last week, the Business Journal exclusively reported that Apple had leased nearly 314,000 square feet of industrial manufacturing space in Milpitas, but the iPhone maker also has nearly 80 acres of entitled and still undeveloped land in neighboring North San Jose.

Meanwhile, many other tech and tech-serving companies have told the Business Journal over the past that they've opted to move to the South Bay as they seek to reduce costs, expand their offices or seek out more urban surroundings.

Office in Sunnyvale, where Micro Focus has long had office space, is among of the tightest in Silicon Valley, currently sitting at 4.09 percent availability for the 15.16 million square feet of Class A office space in the city, according to third quarter data from Newmark Knight Frank. Class A office space in Sunnyvale is currently going for $6.27 per square foot on average per month in the city.

Meanwhile, Santa Clara's availability rate sits around 20.42 percent for the more than 11.58 million square feet of Class A space in the city. Santa Clara's Class A offices are renting for an average of $4.42 per square foot monthly, Newmark Knight Frank data shows.

""One of Santa Clara's biggest strengths from a tenant's perspective is a variety of alternatives,"" says Mike Saign, executive managing director for Newmark.

""You can be in brand-new construction Class A office buildings, build them out from shell, all the way to second generation Class B alternatives at half of market,"" he said in an interview Wednesday.

Even so, there are fewer office space options in Santa Clara today than there was a year ago as companies continue to move in, Saign added.

Representatives for Micro Focus did not respond to requests for comment about the move over a course of several days.

CBRE's Vince Machado and Vincent Scott represented Micro Focus in the deal. Marketing documents for the development show the CBRE's Christian Marent, Bob Steinbock, Mark Christierson and Mike Charters are in charge of leasing the buildings.

Micro Focus merged with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.'s software business in September 2017, creating the seventh largest ""pure-play enterprise software company in the world,"" according to the companies.

HPE recently announced it would be relocating its headquarters from Palo Alto to a newly constructed office campus in San Jose's north side Alviso district known as America Center.

The Towers at Great America, owned by New Jersey-based real estate investment group PGIM Real Estate, are made up of a pair of six-story, Class A office buildings with floorplates spanning more than 50,000 square feet near California's Great America amusement park. Both office buildings in the complex stand at about 318,000 square feet each, making them some of the largest in Silicon Valley, according to Business Journal research.

The multi-tenant complex also includes two five-story parking garages and a 24,000-square-foot amenities building, which was recently retrofitted with sustainable features aimed at making it a net-zero energy structure.

Other tenants in the office park today include tech giant Avaya Inc., business software group MapR Technologies and semiconductor company Applied Micro Circuits Corp., each of which are headquartered at The Towers at Great America.

HIGHLIGHT:еКAbout 260 affordable housing units would be built on the site at 253 Race Street in San Jose, according to documents the Santa Clara County Housing Authority has submitted to city planners.

SAN JOSE - Hundreds of affordable housing units are being planned in central San Jose at the now-shuttered Race Street Fish & Poultry site, though current tax laws could make financing and construction of the project challenging.

About 260 affordable housing units would be built on the site at 253 Race St., according to documents on file with city planners. The Santa Clara County Housing Authority, which bought the property in June, is preparing to demolish the 2.3-acre site and is seeking final city approvals to develop the land.

""These would be affordable rentals,"" Katherine Harasz, executive director of the Housing Authority, said Monday. ""The rents would be determined by whatever financing we can find to build the project.""

The site's main drawback is that it is located mid-block and isn't on a street corner, but overall, its prospects look good once development is complete, said Bob Staedler, principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a land use planning and consultancy.

""You always want that corner presence, but for an affordable project, it's a great location and a great site,"" Staedler said. ""It's pretty close to services and amenities, grocery stores. Affordable housing is a badly needed type of development.""

With housing prices soaring and modestly priced rentals tough to find, these kinds of projects could be successful.еКAnd along with the macro economics of the housing market, nearby development plans may bolster the need for affordable housing in this area.

Among the plans for nearby downtown San Jose: a Google transit village that could bring 15,000 to 20,000 tech workers to the city's central business district, and a major expansion of the Adobe Systems downtown headquarters campus.

""With the amount of affordable housing that's been built in recent years, a project like this will fill a significant need for Silicon Valley,"" Staedler said.

The Housing Authority doesn't yet have a timeline for demolition and isn't certain when actual construction of the rental residences might begin.

""We are probably a couple of years away from the start of construction,"" Harasz said.

One key area of uncertainty for the project has emerged with changes in federal tax laws in recent years.еКAffordable housing projects that feature below-market units often depend on a blend of low-income tax credits that public agencies like The Housing Authority can offer to entice mortgage lenders, according to Harasz.

Prior to recent tax reforms, lenders were willing to provide more financing for projects because they were more anxious to obtain tax credits, she indicated. But with tax reform on the books, lenders aren't necessarily as enamored of government tax credits.

""Tax credits aren't as valuable today as they were in 2017, prior to the new tax laws,"" Harasz said. ""Corporations don't need tax credits as much as they used to.""

That means public agencies have to tweak the old model for getting affordable housing projects financed.",317,Marlize Van Romburgh,22-Oct-18,"Microsoft's Typical Worker Makes $168k A Year - How That Compares With Facebook,",515,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Microsoft's Typical Worker Makes $168k A Year - How That Compares With Facebook,

Microsoft Corp. is the latest major Silicon Valley tech employer to reveal just how much its typical employee earns - and how that compares with its top executive.

The software giant's median employee pay - almost $168,000 - is high, even by Silicon Valley standards, but not quite as high as the typical worker's paycheck at Facebook, Google parent Alphabet Inc., streaming video giant Netflix Inc., or even smaller software companies like cloud storage provider Box.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella earned $25.8 million in total compensation last year.

The company is headquartered in Redmond, Wash., but is a major Silicon Valley employer as well, with about 2,000 employees in the region at last count. Last year, Microsoft purchased 65 acres in North San Jose for a planned 1 million-square-foot campus and started digging in on a big campus expansion in Google's hometown of Mountain View.

Notes on methodology for the median-pay ranking:

еб    Median pay means half of the company's employees, not including the CEO, make less, and half make more. еб    This data is public due to new financial reporting rules in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that require many U.S. public companies to calculate and disclose median worker pay, and how that compares to the CEO's compensation, in their annual filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. еб    The median pay figure for each company does not necessarily reflect that of an employee who is in the Bay Area. Some companies, notably chipmakers like Intel and Cypress Semiconductor, have large manufacturing workforces outside the region. еб    In calculating median pay, the companies notably don't account for the lavish workplace perks that many Bay Area tech employers are known for, including free daily catered meals, generous paid vacation time, and on-campus gyms and laundry facilities. еб    At some companies, like Facebook and Alphabet, median pay includes the value of restricted stock units and other employee benefits. еб    Some of the region's biggest tech employers - including Apple, Inc., Cisco Systems and Adobe Systems - have not yet disclosed their median pay figures. We'll report again as they disclose those numbers.

SAN JOSE  Protesters dressed in white jumpsuits surrounded a bus carrying tech workers Thursday morning near the San Jose State University campus, preventing it from moving for about 45 minutes.

Beginning at about about 8:10 a.m., between 15 to 20 protesters positioned themselves in front and back of the bus near the intersection of North Fourth and San Salvador streets. The protesters, who said the bus was transporting Google employees to the companys campus in Mountain View,еКcarried banners, one of which read Evict Google.

The tech giant is planning a huge development that could bring as many as 20,000 workers to downtown San Jose, raising concerns the project would force out longtime residents. Police said they didnt know if the bus contained Google employees.

The protest disrupted traffic around San Jose State University, and resulted in street closures around the schools 4th Street parking garage.

San Jose and SJSU police were on the scene, and once San Jose police threatened to arrest the protesters, the protesters moved to the sidewalk, allowing the bus to move shortly after 9 a.m.

As the bus turned on to North Fourth Street, the protesters changed We will not be displaced, we will not be erased.

San Jose police spokeswoman Gina Tepoorten said officers at the scene attempted to speak with protesters, who refused to engage in talks. When that effort failed, Tepoorten said officers issued a dispersal order, effectively telling protesters to clear the roadway or risk arrest.

Sandy Perry, president of the Affordable Housing Network of Santa Clara County, said the grassroots effort protested the Google development, saying it will only add to the housing crisis and will force working families to become homeless.

This was a group of people from different organizations who are opposed to this Google project because of all the tens of thousands of people it is going to displace, Perry said, speaking about the possible massive Google village in downtown San Jose.

Tiny apartments are going big.

The co-living startup Starcity, which builds small apartments with shared kitchens and living rooms, plans to start construction next year on over 1,000 new homes in San Francisco and San Jose.

The San Francisco project includes 270 apartments at 475 Minna St. in the South of Market district. Half of the units will be affordable housing for tenants making up to 80 percent of the area median income.

Another 800 apartments are proposed three blocks from San Jose's Diridon Station in what Starcity, which was founded two years ago and is headquartered in San Francisco, calls the largest co-living project in the country. Google is also planning a massive new office campus in the area. Both projects are scheduled to open in 2021, but still require city approvals.

Starcity and other co-living providers like Common and WeWork's WeLive division are betting that residents will live in smaller rooms but also pay a premium for access to shared spaces and a built-in social network. The model is reminiscent of college dorms and single-room-occupancy hotels with shared bathrooms, a longtime refuge for low-income San Franciscans. The difference is Starcity's spaces are brand-new, and it's pouring millions of dollars in renovations and new construction.

Rents aren't cheap. Tenants of Starcity pay $1,500 to $2,000 per month to rent a single room ranging from 180 to 220 square feet. Around 10 to 20 tenants share kitchens and living rooms. One-bedroom apartments where you can have those amenities to yourself in San Francisco rent for more than $3,000.

They also pay a $300 membership fee that gives them access to communal spaces and a cleaning service. But Starcity provides furniture for commons areas and bedrooms, and runs events like wine tastings and volunteering outings.

Starcity previously targeted vacant commercial buildings for housing conversion. It currently has 52 units in four San Francisco buildings. Another 600 units in 10 renovated buildings are slated to open next year.

Starcity CEO Jon Dishotsky said new construction is more financially challenging than renovations but will enable the company to expand rapidly. Starcity has raised $20.3 million from venture capital companies. Dishotsky said the company also has private equity partners and uses traditional bank loans for construction financing.

""How do we scale this in a way that still feels comfortable and can really make a dent in solving the housing affordability crisis?"" he said. ""This demand for middle-income housing in Silicon Valley is absolutely insane.""

Starcity said it can build three times as many residential rooms on a site compared with a traditional apartment model. The SoMa project is on an empty lot that had previously been approved for a smaller project, with 15 apartments, but never got built.

The co-living model has strong growth potential, particularly in SoMa, according to Randy Shaw, executive director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic, a nonprofit that works with tenants.

""People would rather pay more money and be in a situation ... with friends than rent a studio apartment where they have no connection to anybody,"" he said. ""The market is there, especially in that location.""",320,George Avalos,17-Oct-18,Servicenow Sets Plans For Big Expansion In Santa Clara,514,The East Bay Times (california),,"Servicenow Sets Plans For Big Expansion In Santa Clara

HIGHLIGHT:еКServiceNow, a cloud-based provider of software and services for information technology,еКhuman resources, customer relations, and security operations at companies has leased from property developer The Sobrato Organization a yet-to-be-constructed office building that would be big enough to accommodate well over 1,000 employees.

SANTA CLARA  ServiceNow, a fast-growing Silicon Valley tech company, is busy laying plans for a big expansion of its headquarters in Santa Clara, the company said Wednesday.

The cloud-based provider of software and services for information technology, human resources, customer relations, and security operationsеКhas leased from The Sobrato Organization a yet-to-be-constructed office building that would be big enough to accommodate well over 1,000 employees.

ServiceNow is growing quickly and adding employees around the world, saidеКRobert Teed, ServiceNows vice president of Real Estate & Workplace Services. Here in Santa Clara, because of that growth, we are expanding our headquarters campus.

ServiceNow has leased roughly 269,000 square feet from Sobrato, enabling the company to expand into an office building thats expected to begin construction in early 2019, ServiceNow said.

The tech company had previously leased two office buildings that together total roughly 329,000 square feet, along with an amenities building, from Cupertino-based Sobrato, a rental deal ServiceNow struck in 2014. Each building totals approximately 165,000 square feet. These buildings are atеК2215 and 2225 Lawson Lane just north of Central Expressway in Santa Clara.

To launch the next stage of its expansion, ServiceNow has leased a third building that would rise on an adjacent 7.5-acre parcel of empty land on Lawson Lane, a rental deal that begins in 2021, when the building is due to be completed, and expires in 2035. In addition, ServiceNow agreed to extend its lease on the original two buildings through early 2035.

Separately, the company is leasing a 130,000-square-foot building on Jay Street in Santa Clara, a four-minute drive from the main campus on Lawson Lane.

ServiceNow has called the Bay Area home since moving our headquarters here from San Diego in 2014, Teed said.

Executives with Sobrato declined comment about the ServiceNow expansion efforts.

Several tech titans, including Apple, Adobe Systems, Facebook, Google and Amazon, have launched, or are actively planning, an array of major expansions in several Silicon Valley cities, including San Jose.

The ServiceNow expansion underscores that medium-sized and smaller tech companies also have mounted significant growth efforts of their own amid a red-hot South Bay economy that has produced major hiring efforts throughout Silicon Valley and adjacent regions such as San Francisco and the East Bay.

The three existing buildings, by applying employee-space ratios typically used for modern office structures, could in theory accommodate 2,300 employees.

The company didnt specify any totals for its Bay Area staffing levels. In a regulatory filing in August, ServiceNow stated that as of the end of June, its total employee headcount wasеК7,150, compared with 5,571 at the end of June 2017. Thats a 28 percent increase over the one-year period.

The expansion into the third building could accommodate 1,300 more employees.

Over the next few years, we expect to increase our workforce in Santa Clara to several thousand people, Teed said.",321,Janice Bitters,17-Oct-18,Co-living Startup Seeks To Build Nearly 800 Units In Downtown San Jose Amid,765,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Co-living Startup Seeks To Build Nearly 800 Units In Downtown San Jose Amid

Starcity, a co-living development startup that is known for making ""dorm living for adults,"" is eyeing up a downtown San Jose property to build more than 750 units near Diridon Station, in the same area of the city where Google is also buying land for a massive new tech campus.

The San Francisco-based housing developer said Wednesday it is aiming to build its first South Bay project on a 0.77-acre site at 199 Bassett St., where developer KT Urban has already received city approvals to build an 18-story building with 304 units and 10,150 square feet of ground-floor retail.

But Starcity's model of private rooms paired with shared spaces can boost the number of units or rooms in an apartment project threefold, the company said in a statement Wednesday morning.

""Our goal is to make urban living accessible to all, and by developing large co-living projects ... we're able to create neighborhoods within each development, fostering community in high-density urban areas,"" Jon Dishotsky, co-founder and CEO of Starcity, said in a statement.

The proposal comes as Alphabet Inc.-owned search giant Google is working with the city of San Jose to purchase a list of properties near the Diridon Station transit hub on the west side of downtown. If Google's plans come to fruition, it could bring 6 million to 8 million square feet of new development and as many as 20,000 Google employees to the downtown core.

Talks have already begun with the city of San Jose to amend the existing entitlements at 199 Bassett to look less like typical apartment units and more like Starcity's model of fully furnished bedrooms where residents have their own space adjacent to shared spaces, including kitchens and bathrooms. Take a look at some of Starcity's other locations in the slideshow above.

The buildings typically come with flexible, short-term leases that include the cost of shared household supplies and offer bevy of add-on services, including things like dog-walking and laundry services.

Starcity is a venture-backed startup that was valued at $50 million in a funding round earlier this year and emerged as a part of Y Combinator's Summer Batch two years ago.

While KT Urban called their entitled project ""Aviato,"" Starcity is calling its new San Jose vision ""Bassett.""

The co-living development startup announced the potential San Jose project Wednesday along with its fifth housing project in San Francisco, which it is calling Minna for its location at 475 Minna in the city's SOMA district. The Minna will be proposed using a new housing streamlining law, known as SB 35 - the same state law that has allowed for demolition to begin last week on the nearly empty Vallco Mall in Cupertino.

""A solution like Starcity can help provide critically needed housing at scale, and help cities like San Francisco and San Jose retain our middle class families and workforce,"" Sen Scott Wiener (D - San Francisco) said in the statement Wednesday. Wiener authored the SB 35 legislation, which went into effect this year and requires that at least 50 percent of the housing is considered affordable.

Starcity has not indicated it will use SB 35 to build the San Jose proposal, but the startup says the development is aimed at attracting people from different backgrounds.

""Both projects will accommodate not just single people, but couples, families and event multi-generational families, helping Starcity serve a more diverse group of people who want to remain in urban centers,"" Dishotsky said.

While a Wall Street Journal article Tuesday indicated Starcity plans to purchase the property, but public documents show that the property hasn't yet traded hands.

Representatives from KT Urban did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the project Wednesday morning, but this story will be updated if they do.

In the meantime, housing advocates and city officials are praising the announcement that Starcity is pondering a new project in the largest city in the Bay Area.

""Developing housing close to public transit is critical as we work to relieve our skyrocketing housing costs, and reduce congestion and commute times,"" San Jose Mayor Sam Licarrdo said in the statement Wednesday. ""We welcome companies like Starcity, that leverage innovation to build high-density housing in the heart of our city, allowing people to remain in San Jose and enjoy our community's growing vibrancy.""

Just how much some of the country's biggest employers - including Facebook, Alphabet's Google, Salesforce.com and Twitter -еКpay their workers is slowly coming to light.

That's thanks to federal financial reporting rules that require many public companies to calculate and disclose median worker pay, and how that compares to the CEO's compensation.

You can see how 40 of the country's biggest tech employers - including Netflix, eBay, GoPro, PayPal Holdings, Box, Zynga, ServiceNow, Autodesk, Intuitive Surgical, Netgear and Arista Networks -еК compare in the gallery above.

Some interesting findings from our analysis of filings from the country's biggest companies:

еб The most established companies aren't necessarily the ones that pay the highest. Take, for example, chip maker Intel Corp. With revenue last year of almost $63 billion, the Santa Clara-based chip maker is the second-largest semiconductor company in the world, behind only Samsung. But the median Intel worker makes $45,540 less per year than his or her peer at Nvidia Corp., its much smaller rival down the street.

ебеКThe median pay at some companies, like electric carmaker Tesla Inc., can seem shockingly low, especially by Bay Area standards. But keep in mind that Tesla's median pay of $54,816 includes not only engineers and executives at its headquarters in Palo Alto, but also more than 10,000 workers at its auto factory in Fremont. (Tesla notes in its filing that 26 percent of its approximately 36,300 employees are production-line workers.)

ебеКSimilarly, San Francisco-based Square and Yelp both have large customer service operations in the Bay Area - roles that tend to pay much less than even entry-level software engineers.

еб The median employee at San Jose-based payments provider PayPal earns $52,663 less than the same person at its former parent company, eBay.

Median pay means half of the company's employees, not including the CEO, make less, and half make more. In calculating that figure, the companies notably don't account for the lavish workplace perks that many Bay Area tech employers are known for, including free daily catered meals, unlimited snacks and on- campus gyms and laundry facilities.еКAt some companies, like Facebook and Google parent Alphabet, median pay includes the value of restricted stock units and other employee benefits.

Many of the country's biggest tech employers -еКincluding Apple, Cisco Systems, Oracle Corp. and Adobe Systems - have not yet disclosed their median pay figures.

Lenny Siegel is a Bernie Sanders Democrat whose eyes look like they're one rub away from getting all the sleep out. The mayor of Mountain View is also a driving force behind a local initiative up for a vote in November that has huge implications for business - whether companies should pay a head tax for the employees who work in the city.

""I've always believed in progressive taxation,"" said Siegel, a Stanford physics major who says he was kicked out of school for protesting the Vietnam war and who founded and leads the Center for Public Environmental Oversight. A 46-year resident of Mountain View, Siegel has been on the City Council since the start of 2015 and the city's mayor since the start of this year.

""'Progressive,' in this instance, means you tax the entities that are in a position to pay,"" said Siegel, who is running for another City Council term. ""They will benefit from the improvements that we will make as a result of the funds that we raise.""

Mountain View has an estimated population of about 81,000, and only 30,000 of those are registered voters. But it has something most similarly sized cities don't have: a corporate giant as a resident. That company, Google parent Alphabet Inc., employs about 23,000 people who swarm into town every morning clogging streets and freeways, even if many are riding in Google-provided buses.

Several other major corporations also call Mountain View home. Among the Silicon Valley Business Journal's list of 100 top public companies in the Bay Area, four others are based in the city: Intuit Inc., Symantec Corp., Synposis Inc., and Pure Storage Inc. Another major company, Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, also is based there while Microsoft and Samsung have a large presence.

All of those companies would pay much more to the city if Measure P passes. Right now, most businesses pay a $30 per year business tax regardless of size. If it passes, the seven largest companies in town that employ a thousand people or more would owe in the hundreds of thousands of dollars up to Google's $3.3 million.

Other cities have toyed with doing something similar. In Seattle, where Amazon is based, the City Council passed a head tax but then a month later repealed it. Cupertino, which is home to Apple, debated asking voters to consider a tax this year but decided to postpone any vote until 2020 at the earliest.

""It's not a huge tax,"" said Jim Wunderman, president and CEO of the Bay Area Council, whose members are the largest businesses in the region. ""It's probably not an earth-shattering thing. But it's definitely the camel's nose under the tent, and it will send a signal to other cities.""

The signal Wunderman is concerned about is that other cities might be tempted to turn to big employers for money when they need to move and house thousands of workers flocking to those companies, which pay six-figure median salaries and earn profits swollen by billions in federal tax cuts.

""It's really hard for individual businesses to stand up and talk about it, because these days there's this view that's out there that somehow business is the culprit,"" he said.

But another problem that Wunderman and Carl Guardino, his counterpart at the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, face in their Measure P opposition is that their organizations have long championed the kind of business-enabling transportation projects that Mountain View's ballot measure is designed to build. However, those projects were paid for with sales taxes and bridge tolls, which fall most heavily on individuals, especially the poorest ones.

Guardino's rebuttal is the flat-tax argument that says everyone pays. He met last April with two city leaders to get data to quantify his case that businesses already pay their fair share.

""They looked me in the eye and they said they didn't know,"" Guardino said. ""And I said, 'You don't know what you are charging your employers in taxes or fees one time or annually? Then how do you collect it?' I put it in writing. They've never once responded.""

City Councilmember John McAlister and City Manager Dan Rich have another recollection of that meeting. Sales taxes - which have provided a constant $20 million or so annually to Mountain View's city budget since 2000 - are collected by the state, and cities get a share based on formulas. By law, the city cannot say how much any individual business pays, they said.

""It wasn't contentious or adversarial,"" Rich said of the meeting. Guardino ""made a generic, kind of overly broad, request and we did not provide him any detailed information because I didn't think that was a realistic request to fulfill.""

A city poll from June showed that Measure P had wide public support. And, so far, the opposition has no real face. What voters may see in their mind's eye is the multicolored Google logo, whose headquarters are across the freeway from Siegel's house.

Yet Google, though a member of the Bay Area Council and the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, will have no on-the-record statement on the employment tax, a spokeswoman emailed.

""It's a non-issue to them,"" said McAlister, who owns several South Bay Baskin-Robbins ice cream shops that would pay about $8 a head under Measure P compared to $143 paid for each Googler. ""Think about this: They're a company that had $9 billion profit in the last quarterly period and you're looking at $3 million (in Measure P tax)?""

The business community overall is divided over Measure P because even though there are shared interests between small businesses and Silicon Valley's tech giants, their financial resources and the impact of their businesses on transportation systems and housing are widely different.

Two local chambers of commerce, which have a much higher percentage of small business members than the council or leadership group, are either neutral on Measure P, in the case of Mountain View, or have not decided, in the case of the Silicon Valley Organization.

""Mom-and-pop businesses do not do well until our larger businesses, our major employers, are doing well,"" said Matt Mahood, president and CEO of the SVO.

But Mahood added: ""I think every employer, no matter small, medium or large, needs to understand their role in the community. So many of these major employers need to be paying attention to the type of job creation that they are responsible for and that they are investing back into their community.""

Google has been a major contributor to Mountain View through such things as providing a fleet of 16-passenger electric buses that provide no-fare shuttles on a loop through town that carried 350,000 passengers during its pilot phase.

But among other transportation needs, the city has identified an automated guideway transit system from its Caltrain station to Google's campus, which would carry many more passengers, and two rail-street crossing grade separations to allow for more and faster commuter trains. They would likely cost in the hundreds of millions.

""We need to sell bonds to get those projects done,"" Siegel said. ""You can't sell bonds based on counting on somebody to make donations.""

How head taxes compare in tech-heavy cities

еб    At the urging of San Jose State Professor Scott Myers-Lipton and nonprofit leaders, the City Council approved, and voters ratified, Measure G in 2016 to increase the previous city business tax. Employee headcount has been part of the business tax basis since 1984. еб    The new tax doubled anticipated revenue to $25.4 million and adjusts with inflation. еб    The cap on a company's tax amount reached $154,500 in July. еб    Money goes into the general fund.

еб    Measure P was placed on the November ballot by the City Council. еб    City anticipates about $6 million in revenue. еб    Council promises to allocate 80 percent of tax revenue to transportation, 10 percent to affordable housing, 10 percent to general purposes. еб    Google's tax would account for 56 percent of total revenue.

еб    City Council decided not to submit to voters this year. еб    Proposal would have produced $10 million in revenue. еб    Spending plan never fully developed but focused on transportation. еб    Apple would have been source of 92 percent of total revenue

еб    City Council enacted tax in May, rescinded it in June. Voters were not part of the process. еб    Anticipated revenue was $75 million. еб    Tax was targeted on homelessness issues. еб    Amazon would have been the source of 27 percent of total revenue.

HIGHLIGHT:еКEssex Property Trust has paid $104 million for Meridian at Midtown, a 218-unit apartment complex at 1432 W. San Carlos St. in the Midtown section of the city that links downtown San Jose with the booming retail centers of Santana Row and Westfield Valley Fair and the Apple campuses further west.

SAN JOSE  A major real estate investor, amid ongoing interest by tech companies such as Google and Adobe Systems in San Joses urban core, has scooped up a large apartment complex between the citys downtown and its retailing mega hub.

Essex Property Trust has paid $104 million for Meridian at Midtown apartments at 1432 W. San Carlos St., Santa Clara County property records show. The sale was completed Oct. 3.

The 218-unit residential complex is in the Midtown section of the city, which links downtown San Jose with the booming retail centers of Santana Row and Westfield Valley Fair and the Apple campuses further west.

The seller was Republic Urban Properties, the developer of the apartments, which opened in 2014, according to Michael Van Every, president and chief executive officer of San Jose-based Republic Urban.

Midtown is one of the most important neighborhoods in San Jose, especially with what the city is trying to achieve with Google and its investments in downtown San Jose, Van Every said Thursday.

The apartment complex drew purchasing interest in part because the Midtown district is poised to prosper from the wide-ranging changes expected to follow Googles proposed transit village near the Diridon train station downtown.

Mountain View-based Google has proposed a transit-oriented community of office buildings, residences, shops, restaurants and open spaces in downtown San Jose where the search giant would employ 15,000 to 20,000 workers.

Meridian at Midtown's central location is within a mile of Google's proposed campus and the Diridon Station development, which will dramatically shift the core of downtown San Jose closer to Midtown,еКsaid Scott Bales, a managing director with HFF, a commercial realty brokerage that arranged the Midtown deal.

San Mateo-based Essex Property Trust, over the 12 months that ended in June, earned $374.7 million on revenue of $1.44 billion, according to the Yahoo Finance site. This sort of major investment by a big player such as Essex suggests that investors remain bullish about this section of the Bay Area.

Plus, Essex appears confident enough in its investment that it also agreed to assume the responsibility to repay mortgages on the property that Republic Urban undertook. The mortgage debt that Essex is taking over totals $70.1 million, county documents show.

This is a real gateway to the downtown and it connects to Santana Row, Valley Fair and Apple, said Van Every, who said he began working on putting together a development plan for the apartments as early as 2004. Van Every led a group that bought the site for the future apartments in 2010. Construction began in 2012.

The occupancy rate for the apartments is held steadily above 90 percent and the ground-floor retailers also are doing well, Van Every said.

Realty brokers believe the Meridian complex should produce plenty of upside in the rents.

The property should continue to experience tremendous rent growth far into the future, HFFs Bale said.",327,Emily Deruy,2-Oct-18,San Jose Proposal Would Keep Sam Liccardo As Mayor Two Extra Years,827,The Mercury News (california),,"San Jose Proposal Would Keep Sam Liccardo As Mayor Two Extra Years

HIGHLIGHT:еКVice Mayor Magdalena Carrasco and others have proposed aligning mayoral elections with presidential races.

As part of a new proposal to boost voter turnout by moving San Joses mayoral races to the same year as national presidential elections, Sam Liccardo would hold the citys highest elected office an extra two years.

Liccardo will begin his second term in office in January and could end up serving a total of 10 years under the proposal.

In a new memo, Vice Mayor Magdalena Carrasco and her council colleagues Sergio Jimenez, Don Rocha and Chappie Jones call for a ballot measure to pushеКthe mayoral election back two years to 2024 to take advantage of the higher voter turnout that is typical during presidential elections.

We value our electorate, Carrasco said in a statement, and believe that with increased voter turnout we will be able to elevate the Office of the Mayor and capture a more diverse constituent that is reflective of our city.

But the suggestion has sparked concern from some of the citys more right-leaning residents. Councilman Johnny Khamis, one of the councils most conservative members, said he had received a number of phone calls from unhappy people who see the move as a power grab by the left.

Not only would the measure allow Liccardo, a Democrat, to be mayor for a full decade at a pivotal moment in San Jose, as the city prepares for a massive Google campus near Diridon Station and several new BART stations, but it also likely would drive up voter participation among residents who tend to align with Democrats.еКLow-income voters and minorities are more likely to turn out in presidential years.

Are we saying that Mayor Liccardo was illegitimately elected or something? Khamis said, adding that he thinks the idea attempts to fix a problem that doesnt exist. ItеКkind of feels like an effort to make sure whoever runs doesn't have any conservative leanings.

Bob Nunez, the head of the Santa Clara County Republican Party, said hes not concerned about more Democrats turning out but about the mayoral race getting lost in the shuffle.

As Republicans, Nunez said, it is really having the opportunity to go out and talk about very specific issues to our constituents in our cities  and not getting swept up in all the other kinds of things and losing sight of what's important, and that is local politics.

But San Jose State University political science professor Garrick Percival said he thinks when more people vote, it sparks a healthier democracy.

It would lend to more trust in government if people feel like they have a voice in the system, Percival said.

In an op-ed last year, Percival wrote thatеКless than half of the citys registered voters cast ballots when Liccardo was elected in 2014. Two years later, about 80 percent of the citys registered voters weighed in on policy measures.

People are more likely to vote in presidential years, Percival said, because of strongerеКenthusiasm and voter-mobilization efforts. And if a broader, more diverse cross section of the city votes, Percival added, the council would reflect a more accurate representation of residents views.

Just having more people participate, its just better for democracy and better for the city, said Richard Konda, executive director of the Asian Law Alliance.

But Jerry Mungai, a member of the board of directors of the San Jose-based Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility, said robust efforts already exist to get people to participate in all elections.

We already have enough ways to get out the vote, like reducing voter eligibility from age 21 to age 18; vote by mail; DMV mandatory voter registration; ballots in numerous languages, provisional ballot availability on election day, expanded voting time at voting places on election day; just to mention a few, Mungai wrote in an email.

Liccardo, who was not involved in drafting the proposal, said he only recently had a chance to review the memo from his colleagues.

While I appreciate the desire to have a large turnout at the polls, it should be balanced against the importance of having a robust dialogue about local issues without the distraction of the chronic dysfunction consuming our national politics, Liccardo said. I also suspect my wife will raise even greater concerns about giving up our weekends for another two years.

Its unclear whether the measure will ever make the ballot. San Joses Rules Committee will hear the idea on Wednesday, and it could choose to move discussion of the proposal to the City Council in two weeks. The deadline to add items to the November 2018 ballot has passed, so the measure would have to appear on a future ballot.

San Jose would not be the first city to move its mayoral election to line up with presidential election years.

HIGHLIGHT:еКGoogle long has denied that it censors conservatives. Pichai explained during the roughly hour-long private meeting how the company sets up its teams and codes its algorithms to prevent bias, according to a person who attended the meeting but spoke on condition of anonymity.

By Tony Romm | Washington Post

WASHINGTON  Google chief executive Sundar Pichai paid a rare visit to Washington on Friday to defend the search giant against allegations that it silences conservatives online, part of an effort to defuse political tensions between the company and Congress ahead of a hearing later this year.

At a gathering with a dozen Republicans, House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy of California stressed to Pichai that party lawmakers are concerned about whats going on with transparency and the power of social media today, particularly given the fact that Google processes 90 percent of the worlds searches.

Google long has denied that it censors conservatives. Pichai explained during the roughly hour-long private meeting how the company sets up its teams and codes its algorithms to prevent bias, according to a person who attended the meeting but spoke on condition of anonymity.

Pichais trip to Capitol Hill comes in anticipation of his appearance at a hearing later this fall, where lawmakers stressed they would press him not only on charges of censorship but other issues facing the company  including the privacy protections it affords users and its ambitions to relaunch its search engine in heavily censored China.

Exiting the meeting, Pichai described it as constructive and informative, adding in a statement that Google is committed to continuing an active dialogue with members from both sides of the aisle, working proactively with Congress on a variety of issues, explaining how our products help millions of American consumers and businesses, and answering questions as they arise.

Pichais personal outreach  the beginning of more to come  caps off a bruising month for Google in the nations capital. Its been dogged by a series of recent mishaps in the way it presents search results, which Trump has claimed are rigged against him. Fears about the tech industrys size and power also dominated a meeting this week between the Justice Department and state attorneys general, where some officials expressed an openness in investigating Google and its tech industry peers on privacy and antitrust grounds.

Others in Washington question whether Google and the rest of the tech industry are prepared to stop foreign governments, like Russia, from spreading propaganda online ahead of the 2018 election. Yet Google infuriated lawmakers when it opted against sending Pichai or Larry Page, the chief executive of parent-company Alphabet, to testify at a Senate hearing in September on the matter. Instead, lawmakers left an empty chair at the witness table to reflect Googles absence and pilloried the company anyway on a range of issues.

In a sign that some Democrats and Republicans remain miffed at Google, GOP Sen. Richard Burr of Nporth Carolinia and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia the leaders of the panel that had asked Google to testify  declined to meet with Pichai this week, according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak on the record. Burrs office declined to comment; a spokesperson for Warner confirmed the matter.

Instead, Pichai huddled beginning Thursday with lawmakers like House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, spokespeople confirmed. Schatz used the opportunity to press Google on its privacy practices, his aide said, as he and other lawmakers continue to weigh whether they should pass new regulations restricting the way tech giants collect and monetize users data.

At Fridays meeting, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he and his peers had served notice to Pichai to expect questions on everything from antitrust issues to allegations of conservative bias. The date of the hearing in front of the panel has not been announced.

Theres a lot of interest in their algorithm, how those algorithms work, how those algorithms are supervised, Goodlatte said.

Some Republicans also pressed Pichai on Googles ambitions in China, though Pichai stressed that Google is far from a final decision on whether to launch a censored version of its search engine there, according to Goodlatte.

Later, Pichai was expected to shuttle over to the White House for a meeting with Larry Kudlow, the presidents top economic adviser, according to three people familiar with his schedule but not authorized to discuss it publicly. Previously, Kudlow had signaled an openness to regulating Google search results in response to allegations of anti-conservative bias.",333,Inland Valley Daily Bulletin,28-Sep-18,"As Wildfire Closes California Interstate, Waze Sends Drivers Down Dead End",560,The East Bay Times (california),,"As Wildfire Closes California Interstate, Waze Sends Drivers Down Dead End

HIGHLIGHT:еК""Tens of thousands of people are getting off the freeway, going up into our community, and finding out that they have to turn around and come back down.""

When a brush fire closed Cajon Pass for hours on Wednesday, frustrated drivers followed their map apps advice  and ended up at the end of a remote forest road with barely enough room to turn around.

Residents of the tiny Lytle Creek community say the unfortunate detour was the latest in a string of problems caused by Google Maps and Waze whenever theres a blockage on Cajon Pass, the stretch of Interstate 15 between the high desert and the Los Angeles metro area.

John Ruha, a Lytle Creek resident, said northbound drivers leave I-15 and head up Lytle Creek Road, thinking theyll be able to cut back to the interstate. Eventually, he said, they hit a locked gate, forcing them to turn around.

""Tens of thousands of people are getting off the freeway, going up into our community, and finding out that they have to turn around and come back down,"" Ruha said.

""That's not just cars and trucks. Semis are going up there, buses, you name it. It's creating a huge problem.""

Its eight miles from the freeway to the mountain community. Three miles past that, the pavement ends. Theres a shooting range there, and its website addresses the remoteness: When you think you are lost, keep driving  we are out here.

While the misdirected traffic is an inconvenience, Ruha noted it's a potential public safety risk if emergency vehicles are unable to get through to the community.

Roni Edis, spokesman for the San Bernardino County Public Works Department, concurred, saying that if Wednesday's Keenbrook Fire had shifted to Lytle Creek, those motorists would have been stuck there.

""We've actually sent some information to Google Maps and Waze to try to get them to not send people to those areas  but have never been able to get anywhere with them about it,"" Edis said.

The Keenbrook Fire started around 11 a.m. Wednesday on the west side of I-15, four miles southeast of Lytle Creek, and reached 20 acres in less than an hour. Both directions of the freeway were closed. Within a few hours it was at 50 acres, and traffic was backed up for miles.

The U.S. Forest Service, which has jurisdiction over Lytle Creek Road north of the community of Lytle Creek, has also had conversations with Google about the redirection to forest roads, said Zach Behrens, a Forest Service spokesman.

Signs on Lytle Creek Road inform motorists that there is no access to I-15 or to Lone Pine Canyon Road, which runs between Cajon Pass and the town of Wrightwood.

Despite the official warnings, Edis said, motorists will ignore the signs and instead rely on their smartphones.

""People need to obey and listen to the signs,"" Edis said. ""If you see signs out there that say 'Don't go that way' - even if Waze or Google told you to - it doesn't necessarily mean it's a safe way to go.""

Ruha said he'd like to see signs to that effect posted immediately off the freeway. And, when there is an incident in the Cajon Pass, he hopes the California Highway Patrol will provide an officer to direct traffic away from local roads.",334,George Avalos,27-Sep-18,Investors Grab Big San Jose Tech Campus Amid Rising Property Values,527,The East Bay Times (california),,"Investors Grab Big San Jose Tech Campus Amid Rising Property Values

HIGHLIGHT:еКAn affiliate of Beverly Hills-based realty investment and management firm Kennedy Wilson, KW Fund VI Valley Oak, paid $81.2 million on June 26 for five buildings that were owned by Sobrato Family Foundation, according to Santa Clara County property records.

SAN JOSE  A big investment company has bought several office buildings in south San Jose from a stalwart Silicon Valley developer, Sobrato Organization, in a purchase that suggests investors are bullish on the tech company clusters in that area.

KW Fund VI Valley Oak, an affiliate of Beverly Hills-based realty investment and management firm Kennedy Wilson, paid $81.2 million on June 26 for five buildings sold by the Sobrato Family Foundation, according to Santa Clara County property records.

Amid a boom in leases and purchases of big office buildings throughout Silicon Valley the last few years, industry experts believe south San Jose is becoming a more attractive option when compared with more pricey parts of the Bay Area.

The factors behind this trend include the brutal commute patterns in the Bay Area that have shoved a growing number of motorists into grinding drives to and from work.

Going to work in south San Jose is a reverse commute, said Clay Jubran, an associate and broker with Colliers International, a commercial realty firm. People are getting sick of sitting in traffic.

Whats more, a price differential has emerged between office rents and property values in south San Jose compared with other markets that have become ultra-popular destinations for tech giants and property investors.

According to estimates from Colliers, North San Jose office building values range from $200 to $250 a square foot, and office rents in that area range from $2.50 to $3 a square foot per month. South San Jose property values for office buildings range from $150 to $175 a square foot and per-month office rents are in the $1.25 to $1.35 range.

Rents are going up not only in Sunnyvale, Mountain View and Palo Alto, but also in north San Jose and the Fremont corridor, Jubran said.

Through a combination of property purchases or leases, tech titans such as Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Adobe Systems have launched, or are actively planning, huge expansions of their operations throughout Silicon Valley and nearby regions such as San Francisco.

The tech company shopping spree for new sites has gobbled up office space, squeezed out some tenants and forced office rents higher in the Bay Area.

The new ownerеКof the Valley Oak Technology Center, Kennedy Wilson, has $16 billion in commercial property assets under management, with a primary focus on office buildings and multi-family properties, according to the publicly held companys web site.

The Valley Oak complex totals 430,000 square feet and four of the five buildings are occupied. Extreme Networks, Jabil and Northrop Grumman are the tenants. A few months ago, Extreme Networks renewed a lease with Sobrato in one of the buildings in the complex and signed a lease to expand into an adjacent building.

The five buildings areеКlocated at San Ignacio Avenue and Via Del Oro, a short distance from State Route 85.еКThe $81 million sale of Valley Oak Technology Center was arranged through CBRE commercial realty brokers Scott Prosser and Joseph Moriarty.

Right now, south San Jose is a lower-cost alternative for tenants looking to lease space, but that could potential change as rents rise, Jubran said.",335,Levi Sumagaysay,26-Sep-18,U.s. Senators To Google: What Are Your China Search Plans?,558,The East Bay Times (california),,"U.s. Senators To Google: What Are Your China Search Plans?

HIGHLIGHT:еКGoogle's controversial China search project, dubbed Project Dragonfly, gets scrutinized at a Senate committee's data privacy hearing in Washington.

Googles plans to revive search in China got a turn in the spotlight Wednesday during a Senate committee hearing about Americans online data privacy.

Google, which was among the handful of companies that sent a top executive to testify before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, was asked repeatedly about its reported plans to resume providing a search engine in China after pulling out of that market eight years ago over censorship issues.

In August, the Intercept reported that Google had decided to launch a search engine in China that would yield to that nations laws and blacklist certain search terms, such as human rights, democracy, religion and more. A research scientist who quit working at GoogleеКin August over the issue, Jack Poulson, wrote the Senate committee leaders a letter with details about the project, dubbed Dragonfly. For example, Poulson claims that the company has a prototype interface that would allow a partner Chinese company access to users search history based on their phone numbers  a concern given the governments history of cracking down on dissidents.

How will Google square its stated privacy values with this flawed Chinese search engine and the very real possibility that it may be used to repress human rights? asked Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-New Hampshire.

As he did several times during the hearing, which was livestreamed, Google Chief Privacy Officer Keith Enright said the company is not close to launching a search engine in China. If we were, my team would be actively engaged, he added.

Enright later said, in response to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that there is a Project Dragonfly, but that in his capacity as the companys chief privacy officer, he was not clear on the contours of the scope of the project.

Googles head of search, Ben Gomes, also told this news organization earlier this week that the project is in its exploratory stages.

Poulson, the former Googler, also noted in his letter that details about Project Dragonfly were discussed extensively internally, and that such discussion has since been increasingly stifled.

When asked about Poulsons letter, a Google spokeswoman would only refer to the companys initial statement about Project Dragonfly, that the company has been investing for many years to help Chinese users, but that it is not close to launching search there.

Other tech giants didnt escape questions about China. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colorado, asked Apple and Amazon executives about their companies policies in that nation, including how much they comply with Chinese demands.

HIGHLIGHT:еКDaniel Harris has helmed the Knight Foundation's San Jose program for four years.

Four years after he arrived, the Knight Foundation's San Jose program director is leaving Silicon Valley.

Daniel Harris announced Tuesday that his last day on the job will be Oct. 12. After that, he said during a phone conversation, he will return home to pursue ""other opportunities"" in New York with his wife and two children, including a son born this past Sunday.

""Regardless of my zip code, I will always remain a champion for this wonderful city and stay connected to the important work still to be done,"" Harris wrote in an email announcing his departure. ""San Jose's future looks ever-so-bright with all of you leading the charge for a more inclusive, vibrant, and people-focused city.""

The organization is still in the process of determining who will fill the role moving forward, but Harris insisted that Knight ""remains committed to San Jose.""

During his time in the nation's 10th largest city, Harris said, his team awarded at least 250 grants worth more than $16 million. He's shaped everything from the city's appearance to the festivals it hosts.

""There are few people who have had such a tremendous impact on San Jose in such a short time,"" Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a phone interview. ""In addition to being a great champion for our community, Danny's vision and creative thinking has inspired many around him to take on the cause of place making in our city.""

Harris championed Viva Calle, an annual event that closes some San Jose streets to cars, opening the roads for bikers and walkers to explore the city. He's been deeply involved in conversations about how the Diridon Station area - set to be home to a massive Google campus - and the Guadalupe River front should look.

The goal, Harris said, has been to try to ""reorient the compass of the city around the resident and not the automobile.""

That's a mammoth task in a city known for its sprawl and suburban feel. And if he harbored the belief when he arrived, Harris isn't under any illusion now that San Jose should try to compete with San Francisco or New York.

Rather, Harris said, ""I think San Jose should be the global model of how suburban cities urbanize,"" a guiding star for cities like Atlanta and Dallas and Manila.

Likening his job to that of a therapist, Harris said he wants San Jose to have the self-confidence to see itself as a world-class city in its own way - a welcoming, authentic city regarded for its diversity and deep sense of innovation.

""He helped us see and realized our city's potential, and understand the importance of public life and public spaces to unite people across difference and connect them to their place,"" saidеКDeputy City Manager Kim Walesh. ""He empowered emerging leaders to step up, learn from each other and from peers nationally, and take creative initiative to make things happen.""

It's that last bit - supporting emerging leaders - that Harris thinks will be his most important legacy, and perhaps the most enduring.

He knows that four years is a blip in the lifetime of a city, but Harris says his time in San Jose has left him optimistic about the future.

""It seems like the city is in this really unique moment,"" he said. ""I'm really confident in the leadership.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКAhead of the hearing, Google's CEO also plans to visit the nation's capital this Friday to meet with Democratic and Republican members of Congress.

Google said Monday that Sundar Pichai, its chief executive, has agreed to testify to Congress this year following Republican lawmakers continued criticism that major tech platforms and social media sites are censoring conservatives online.

Pichai agreed to participate in the unscheduled hearing in response to a request from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, who like other Republicans, including President Donald Trump, has blasted Google on grounds that it silences right-leaning news, views and users  and has failed to answer lawmakers questions in person.

Ahead of the hearing, Pichai also plans to visit the nations capital this Friday to meet with Democratic and Republican members of Congress, including a session with McCarthy and two dozen GOP colleagues, a spokesman for the GOP leader confirmed Monday. The visit comes weeks after Pichai and Larry Page, the chief executive of Googles parent company, Alphabet, each declined to appear at a hearing focused on the 2018 election, sparking bipartisan outrage.

I look forward to meeting with members on both sides of the aisle, answering a wide range of questions, and explaining our approach, Pichai said in a statement Monday. These meetings will continue Googles long history of engaging with Congress, including testifying seven times to Congress this year.

When he arrives in Washington, D.C., Pichai is sure to face a barrage of bipartisan scrutiny  focused on everything from the companys approach to privacy protection to its efforts to thwart foreign governments, including Russia, from spreading disinformation online. Others, including McCarthy, have blasted Google for its reported ambitions to launch a search engine in China that meets Beijings strict censorship rules.

But Google must also combat heightened election-year attacks that it is biased against conservatives. Trump has accused Google of rigged search results against him, giving better billing to negative stories about his administration  a charge the president levied without evidence.

Google has denied it rigs its search results.

Trumps top aides later suggested regulating Googles presentation of search results. For its part, the Justice Department plans to convene state attorneys general  which have the power to investigate and penalize tech giants such as Google  for an event in Washington on Tuesday exploring Silicon Valleys online filtering practices.

In an attempt to console employees, Pichai in particular said that Trumps victory had caused a lot of fear within Google. And internal Google emails surfaced by the Wall Street Journal showed company engineers discussing ways to tweak search results in a way to help users who were looking to fight the president on his travel ban, though such ideas never were implemented.",338,George Avalos,24-Sep-18,San Jose Towers Could Get A Lot Taller Downtown,531,The East Bay Times (california),,"San Jose Towers Could Get A Lot Taller Downtown

HIGHLIGHT:еКFor the first time in 10 years, San Jose city officials, amid a burst of new towers and development proposals, as well as major expansions being eyed by Google and Adobe Systems in the city's urban core, have launched a major study of raising the heights of buildings in the downtown area.

SAN JOSE  Downtown San Jose could boast significantly taller buildings, both in the existing core area and the neighborhood where Google is eyeing a transit-oriented village, after the first official review in a decade regarding height limits in the Bay Areas largest city.

Much of downtown San Jose lies beneath or near the flight paths of airplanes going in and out of San Jose International Airport. Depending on the downtown section where a building might be constructed, city rules place height limits on buildings ranging from roughly 120 feet to 200 feet - which works out to roughly 10 to 16 stories.

There is a real focus on density in downtown San Jose, and the only way you can create density that makes a difference is to try to have higher buildings, said Scott Knies, executive director of the San Jose Downtown Association.

San Jose city officials, amid a burst of new towers and development proposals, as well as major expansions being eyed by Google and Adobe Systems in the citys urban core, have launched a major study of raising the heights of buildings in the downtown area.

About four scenarios are being considered by San Jose policy makers and city staffers. The first public airing of the alternatives for higher buildings occurred Monday atеК the City Councils Community and Economic Development Committee, chaired by CouncilmanеКJohnny Khamis.

The real issue, the real focus, is on the core downtown area plus the Diridon Station area, said Kelly Kline, chief economic development and land use officer with the office of San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo. There could be fairly significant opportunities in the Diridon Station area for higher buildings.

San Jose officials, as they ponder how to enable much higher buildings downtown, must balance the needs of airlines that use the citys fast-growing airport with the desire by local business leaders and property owners to increase density.

Our hope is to develop a consensus viewpoint with all of the people who care about the downtown and who care about the airport, said Kim Walesh, San Joses director of economic development. We are hoping for potential conclusions and a recommended strategy for height limits by the end of this year.

In the Diridon train station area, theеКhighest building is the SAP Center, a 110-foot-tall sports and entertainment complex. The Federal Aviation Administration rules typically would cap buildings at 230 feet in the flight path areas.

You could have a building twice as high as SAP Center, even in the Diridon Station area, Knies said. This is an economic issue. It is not a safety issue.

The vast majority of flights wouldnt be affected by a big jump in height limits for downtown San Jose buildings, experts said.

In analyzing all of the flights connecting to San Jose airport, there are only a handful of flights that could be impacted, Knies said. Its primarily the flights from Asia.

The debate over the height limits also underscores the interwoven relationship between the airport and the downtown district, John Aitken, San Joses director of aviation, told the council committee during a presentation Monday.

Downtown needs the airport, and we need the jobs downtown, Aitken said.",339,Levi Sumagaysay,24-Sep-18,Google At 20: Tech Giant Unveils Three Big Shifts In Search,850,The East Bay Times (california),,"Google At 20: Tech Giant Unveils Three Big Shifts In Search

HIGHLIGHT:еКPlus, Ben Gomes, longtime engineer and now head of search at Google, addresses challenges and controversies facing the company.

SAN FRANCISCO - Google, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this week, on Monday looked to the future as it unveiled three big shifts in search that appear to take aim at some of its biggest competitors.

With Journeys, search users will have a chance to collect their searches and results over time. The company is also anticipating query-less searches, with VP of Search Ben Gomes saying, We want to solve queries we haven't even seen. And its doubling down on visual.

Gomes, one of Googles first principal engineers and now its head of search, kicked off Mondays press event in San Francisco by putting into perspective how far Google and the web have come.

""When Google was founded, the web was 25 million pages then,"" said Gomes, who has been with the company for 19 of its 20 years. ""Now, there are hundreds of billions of pages.

The feel-good event came as the company is facing challenges galore, from questions about its reported revival of search efforts in China to controversy over leaked emails that showed Google employees discussing ways they might make changes in search to respond to President Donald Trump's travel ban. Even though the company says no changes were made after those discussions, the news helped fuel even more conservative complaints that Google, like other tech giants, is too politically liberal.

The kind of work we do, there's a lot of scrutiny, Gomes said in an interview after the keynote address. ""We welcome that. He said Google has an open culture, and follows processes and a system of testing its products and algorithms.

As for whether the company is looking to revive search in China after leaving that market years ago over censorship and cybersecurity concerns, Gomes called it exploratory.

The first big shift in search that the company announced Monday is all about organization. Google has found that online searchers keep going back to the same topics, said Nick Fox, vice president of Search and Assistant products. The companys new Journeys feature aims to give searchers a place to organize what they've searched for and found. Its like Pinterest for search, but with an activity card that helps people pick up where they left off. More ways to organize and track content related to different search topics are coming.

Second, these days, tech companies want to anticipate our needs - and searches. The search giant is therefore ramping up its effort on query-less searches, including by expanding the Google feed. The feed, which launched last year and now has 800 million monthly active users, is being rebranded as Discover. It surfaces articles, videos and other content tailored to users' interests, a la Facebook. Discovers reach is expanding, too: Its coming to Googles home page on mobile.

And third, Google Images is one of the most popular features of search, according to Cathy Edwards, vice president of Google Images. So the company is adding more related content to image searches, including video. It is also doubling down on visual stories in mobile. Think Snapchat or Instagram stories. And the company is incorporating Google Lens into Google Images, so clicking on the lens icon in Google Images yields a plethora of related images and content.

Google also highlighted initiatives that go beyond helping people find information for knowledges sake. It also wants to help them with their well-being, such as finding safety during times of crisis. For example, the company is using artificial intelligence  which is key to much of its search efforts  and is working with government agencies in India to help send flood alerts to the public that include crucial information such as when, where and severity of flooding.

Finally, Google  like LinkedIn  is going beyond simply providing job listings and connections. The company is working with the state of Virginia and its community colleges so it can help find not only jobs, but training for jobs. Last month, Google rolled out job-search tools for military veterans.

Also during the interview, Gomes talked about what keeps him going after almost two decades at the tech giant, which is celebrating its 20th year this Thursday.

Its personal for him. During his keynote address, Gomes mentioned that he grew up in India with access to only one library.еКWhat I could study or learn was limited to books that were in that library, he said.

Later, he said in an interview: Google touches people all over the world, including kids who dont have opportunity to have access to information. He called reaching into developing countries, where information deserts remain, the companys biggest challenge in search.

We have a long journey ahead, Gomes said. It keeps me motivated and still excited.",340,Rex Crum,22-Sep-18,Google Ceo: Employees Need To Keep Politics Out Of Their Work,351,The East Bay Times (california),,"Google Ceo: Employees Need To Keep Politics Out Of Their Work

HIGHLIGHT:еКIn a memo to Google employees, CEO Sundar Pichai warns ""Googlers"" to keep their personal politics out of their work and company products

Faced with growing criticism that his companys best known products and services may be biased by its employees political views, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai has urged those who work at the internet giant to keep their opinions on politics to themselves.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Pichai sent a memo to Googles employees, also known as Googlers, on Friday warning them toеКthat if they do anything that undermines (users) trust, we will hold them accountable.

""We do not bias our products to favor any political agenda, Pichai said, in a copy of the memo that Journal said it obtained. The trust our users place in us is our greatest asset and we must always protect it.

Pichais laying down of the law regarding employees political bias in their work comes after the leaking to the public of some discussions by Google employees that appeared to show those workers lamenting the policies and administration of President Donald Trump.

Among the matters that the Journal said Google employees talked about was President Trumps January 2017 travel ban, and ways that they could alter Google search functions to connect people to organizations and efforts opposed to the travel ban.

In his memo, Pichai said no such changes were put in place.

HIGHLIGHT:еКIf we can't afford to pay our employees more, the district should provide support in other areas

As a former nonprofit director, I believe in the power of partnerships. In order to fund new programs, projects, or initiatives, it is critical to build connections with government agencies, charitable foundations, and corporate philanthropy.

The same mentality should apply to public school districts, especially those like San Jose Unified that struggle to meet their needs with limited resources allocated by the state based on outdated funding formulas.

The success of the Measure A housing bond presents an opportunity for partnership with Santa Clara County to create more affordable housing for the ""missing middle"" - including teachers, nurses, and other school employees - who generally earn too much to qualify for subsidies but too little to afford market-rate rents and home prices.

Unfortunately, potential sites like the former San JosМ© City Hall Annex have become pawns in triangulated proxy wars between housing advocates, neighborhood activists, and government officials over how Measure A dollars should be spent.

While others posture and fight over solutions, school districts can and should play a key role in the process.

Supervisor Cindy Chavez recently called on school districts to come to the table with land, resources, or ideas for affordable housing projects that the county could fund, and her request for leadership was music to my ears.

As the largest district in the county, with more than 30,000 students and 4,000 full- and part-time employees, San Jose Unified would be a natural leader in this arena.

Our district is also in a unique position to leverage Measure A dollars as the single largest property owner in San Jose, with more than 3 million square feet of land and facilities.

The housing crisis is impacting all of us. Enrollment is on the decline in our downtown schools as working class families are forced out of the area by skyrocketing rents and property values. This displacement is becoming particularly pronounced with the anticipation of a massive Google campus about to land completely within San Jose Unified's boundaries.

With declining enrollment comes a decline in funding, creating a vicious cycle that puts additional stress, anxiety, and trauma on our educators, who are facing severe financial pressures outside the classroom.

A teacher in their first year of service with San Jose Unified makes $55,000 a year before taxes, well below the average median income for our area. If they avoid early burnout and somehow make it to 30 years, the same teacher is still only making $92,000 annually. The situation for our classified employees - more than 1,200 of them - is even worse.

The high cost of living in Silicon Valley makes the current nationwide educator shortage more pronounced, as San Jose Unified struggles to recruit and retain teachers and educational staff, particularly in key areas such as math, bilingual, and special education.

Last week, the Board of Education took a step in the right direction by asking staff to develop a master plan for district properties in order to identify underutilized lands and facilities that could be leveraged for housing or other community benefits.

While this is encouraging progress, it will take future boards to follow through and realize the full potential of partnerships between Santa Clara County, the City of San Jose, and surrounding school districts to create housing solutions that support our entire educational family.

Lew Wolff has spent a major portion of the past six decades stumping for San Jose, a longtime underdog municipality in growing Silicon Valley where most cities have filled with investors, massive developments and tech titans.

Until recently, San Jose's story is one of often being overlooked by such investment, save for a handful of tech and development pioneers that have stuck with the city through repeated false starts when it almost looked like the South Bay city would finally hit its stride. Few, however have been as vocal or tireless a booster as Lew Wolff.

Now, San Jose's most recent boom is looking to be the real deal. The city is preparing for a potentially massive new Google campus near a set of major transit upgrades; one of its earliest and most loyal tech tenants, Adobe, is planning a big expansion; and the most prolific developers in the Bay Area are looking to San Jose as their next frontier.

But the foundation that allowed the city to grow the way it has was built decades ago in part by Wolff, say several current and former city leaders.

""We are a better city because of Lew and as I tell many folks in the development community today, we are creating America's next great city,"" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said. ""But we could only get to this place because of folks that believed in us, and Lew was primary among them.""

It's that legacy that prompted the Business Journal, along with its panel of expert judges, to recognize Lew Wolff with its first-ever ""Pioneer"" award. This award isn't to be given annually, but when merited by long-term vision, risk-taking and action that has ultimately shaped Silicon Valley in lasting ways.

Wolff, since arriving in the Valley in 1961 and spending years as one of the most active developers in San Jose, has done just that.

The 'path of growth'

When Wolff arrived in San Jose as a seasoned real estate appraiser from St. Louis, the city was primed for a change, former San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery remembers.

""What he waded into, it was almost like there had been a nuclear explosion downtown, and very little was left of what had existed there from Pueblo days until really the Kennedy era,"" McEnery said. ""Somebody coming into that, and I recognized this in Lew, had a tremendous ... vision of what San Jose could be.""

Indeed, Wolff says he was sure there was potential in San Jose's downtown back then. He wanted to build a financial center and ultimately collaborated with the city and local businesses to pick up a stalled, but major, redevelopment project in downtown. That project, then named Park Center Plaza, was home to multiple financial institutions, an industry that once made up the bulk of downtown San Jose's tenant base.

""I thought San Jose was in the path of growth,"" he recalled in an interview earlier this year. ""Unfortunately, we were actually on the edge of growth, but I didn't realize it.""

Today, the old Park Center Plaza is still home to several big banks, including Wells Fargo and Bank of America. But it has changed over the years and become CityView Plaza, an approximately 600,000-square-foot mixed-use office plaza recently purchased by prolific San Francisco-based developer Jay Paul Co.

Wolff is also well-known for his interest and ties in local sports, at one time owning a big stake in the Oakland A's. He made a valiant effort to bring the team to San Jose, which ultimately fell flat.

But he did successfully build a stadium in the city, which he says was a major boost in his goal to make San Jose a household name. He and A's owner John Fisher worked to build Avaya Stadium, where the San Jose Earthquakes play. Wolff still has an ownership stake in the professional soccer team.

""Professional sports have an important role to play in the lives of the residents of the city, and soccer is one of those things that people love,"" former San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed said. ""It is important to have these kinds of sports and cultural facilities and soccer gives us national attention, national publicity, national name recognition.""

The 'next round'

But as San Jose's name recognition grows, and Jay Paul and other developers begin to dig into downtown, Wolff, who is now 82, is beginning to pull back on his holdings - though not his enthusiasm for the area, he assures me.

In January, Wolff let go of the Fairmont Hotel, which he - through a company he co-founded called Maritz, Wolff & Co. - bought from the San Jose Redevelopment Agency in 1996. The purchase came during an economic slump when the hotel was at risk of going into foreclosure.

""I think we saved the Fairmont,"" he recalls. ""I used to tease the mayor at the time, Mayor McEnery, that it's going to be the largest Days Inn in the country if we don't do something.""

In the years after buying what was then a single building, 20-story hotel, Maritz, Wolff & Co. built an annex, which stands at 14 stories and brought the total room count at the Fairmont to 805. The group also invested millions of dollars in renovations to the buildings over the years, selling it for more than $221 million this year.

Not long after the Fairmont sale, Wolff and longtime business associate J.P. DiNapoli sold to Adobe a 2.5-acre slice of already-entitled land across from the tech giant's existing headquarters.

Wolff and DiNapoli had already gotten a design for an 18-story commercial tower approved for the site, not because they thought Adobe would buy it, but because it was the right place for a big office tower, Wolff said.

Adobe is now planning to build a fourth tower and more than double its workforce.

John DiNapoli, president at JP DiNapoli Cos., praised Wolff and his own father Phil, who is the director at DiNapoli Cos., for their efforts in the city's downtown core over the years in a statement to the Business Journal leading up to the sale to Adobe.

""Lew brought us professional soccer and saved the San Jose Fairmont from default,"" he said. ""Lew and my father led redevelopment of the Central Business District when others turned their backs on downtown San Jose.""

But now people aren't turning their backs on San Jose, and Wolff, just as much as ever before - or maybe a little more - is optimistic about the South Bay city he's been advocating for most of his life.

""I want people who live in Palo Alto who want to go to a play, to turn their cars toward San Jose rather than San Francisco,"" he said. ""To do that, you need to have a critical mass that we're finally getting. I did my part, but I think ... the next round is going to be fantastic for downtown.""

Lew Wolff has been instrumental in the development of several downtown San Jose buildings, including the Fairmont Hotel, above, and CityView Plaza, bottom right. He also ushered in Avaya Stadium, top right, home of the San Jose Earthquakes.

The highest-paying big Bay Area tech employer isn't a behemoth like Google, Salesforce.com or Intel. It's not even Facebook, although the typical worker at the Menlo Park social media giant takes home a whopping $240,430 annual salary.

It's Splunk Inc. - the fast-growing data-processing software firm that's doubling its Bay Area footprint and recently leased an entire new office building at San Jose's Santana Row project.

The median worker at Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK) makes a $256,370 per year, according to its public company filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That's almost $16,000 more than your typical Facebook worker makes and an amazing $43,000 more than what the median Googler takes home. (Median pay means half of the company's employees, not including the CEO, make less, and half make more.)

You can see how many of region's biggest tech employers - including Facebook, Google parent Alphabet, Inc., Intel Corp., Tesla, eBay, GoPro, PayPal Holdings, Electronic Arts Inc., Zynga, ServiceNow, Autodesk, Intuitive Surgical, Netgear, Inc., Arista Networks, Square, inc. and Yelp - compare in the gallery below.

Splunk recently agreed to expand into another 300,000 square feet at 700 Santana Row, an eight-story, under-construction office building next to the bustling shopping center in San Jose where it's had offices for the past three years. The recent lease deal marks a big expansion of Splunk's existing footprint at the mixed-use project, which is notable because the company was the first major office tenant to sign a full-building lease there in 2015, when it took over 234,000 square feet at next-door 500 Santana Row.

Though Splunk's headquarters remains in San Francisco, the company noted that its new Santana Row footprint, at more than 500,000 square feet, will actually be its largest office worldwide.

The company is also expanding in its hometown, where it's adding 100,000 square feet at 250 Brannan St. in San Francisco -еКpreviously its longtime headquarters space -еКin addition to the 210,000 square feet at 270 Brannan St. it already occupies.

""As Splunk continues to grow and hire across the company, it is critical we provide our employees the best possible work environment,"" Splunk President and CEO Doug Merritt said in a statement about the company's hiring plans. ""We're thrilled to continue our expansion in San Francisco and San Jose and proud to be bringing thousands of jobs to the Bay Area.""

Between its new South Bay and San Francisco offices, the company is adding some 2,000 jobs to its workforce of 4,000, it said.

Notes on methodology for the median-pay ranking:

еб Median pay means half of the company's employees, not including the CEO, make less, and half make more.

еб This data is public due to new financial reporting rules that require many U.S. public companies to calculate and disclose median worker pay, and how that compares to the CEO's compensation, in their filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

еб In calculating that figure, the companies notably don't account for the lavish workplace perks that many Bay Area tech employers are known for, including free daily catered meals, unlimited snacks and on-campus gyms and laundry facilities.

еб At some companies, like Facebook and Google parent Alphabet, median pay includes the value of restricted stock units and other employee benefits.

еб New to the list since the last time we produced this ranking: Splunk Inc., Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Veeva Systems Inc., Illumina, Inc., Fortinet, Citrix Systems Inc., Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Raytheon Co., FireEye Inc., Cadence Design Systems and NetApp.

еб Many of the region's biggest tech employers - including Apple, Inc., Cisco Systems, Oracle Corp. and Adobe Systems - have not yet disclosed their median pay figures. We'll report again as they disclose those numbers.

HIGHLIGHT:еКIn most cases, up to five elected officials will be able to travel at once.

Several months after a visit to Japan touched off a wave of controversy, the San Jose City Council voted to restrict how many council members can travel at any given time.

On Tuesday, the council agreed with a proposal from Councilman Raul Peralez that up to five elected members can be away from San Jose at the same time, unless it knowingly affects a public meeting in which a quorum is needed.

Previously, the citys travel policy said officials and their staffers could travel at the citys expense as long as there was some public benefit, without a limit on the number of people. In April, Peralez and four other council members Sylvia Arenas, Lan Diep, Sergio Jimenez and Johnny Khamis  participated in a Sister Cities visit to Okayama, Japan, prompting the cancellation of a committee meeting and the rescheduling of a study session.

At the recommendation of staffers at City Hall who had been asked to review the travel policy, the council also voted to require council members participating in both officialеКand unofficial trips  like an upcoming visit to Seattle organized by the Silicon Valley Organization  to notify the City Clerks office several weeks in advance. Previously, it wasnt always clear who was planning to go on trips.

For official trips like a Sister Cities visit, the new policy will also create an official delegation leader, typically the mayor or someone he designates as his representative if he is unable to attend. Travel for that person will be covered by the citys Mayor/Council Travel Fund, while council members who choose to attend but arent technically the designated lead can pay for their trips using either their council office budgets or personal funds.

Mayor Sam Liccardo had argued for even tighter restrictions on council travel, and objected to council members using their office budgets to fund trips.

Its not about us, he told his fellow council members on Tuesday. Its about the citizens.

Most residents, Liccardo argued, wont see how it benefits them toеКhave multiple council members attend a trip.

But some council members took issue with his statements, including Lan Diep, who said he sees value in council members taking part in trips.

This is not wasteful in my opinion, Diep said. These trips are scheduled quite fully to meet government officials from other areas and they take you behind the scenes to see how their cities are run in a way you would never see if you were just buying a plane ticket through a travel agency.

In the last 17 years, there have been nine Sister City trips, where council members have met with officials from Tainan, Taiwan to Dublin, Ireland to discuss a variety of topics, from housing to the economy.

Another Dublin visit is planned for mid-October, and on Tuesday, the council also approved sending Vice Mayor Magdalena Carrasco, who sits on the board of Sister Cities International, as the delegation lead and Lan Diep, who will use office and personal funds to pay for the trip.

At the same time, the council also agreed to permit the mayor and several council members to go on the SVOs unofficial annual study mission to Seattle. As San Jose prepares for Google to build out a large campus near Diridon Station, officials have said they want to understand and learn from Seattles experience with bringing Amazon to that city.

C2,"Massive Building Boom Tears Through City

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Sleek new condos rise up amid the graffiti-covered warehouses, artist's studios and homeless encampments of West Oakland. Construction cranes dot the downtown skyline, and scaffolding-shrouded towers march down Broadway into Temescal.

An extraordinary residential building boom is shaking up Oakland, part of a transformation sweeping the Bay Area as market forces and political initiative combine to address the region's desperate housing crisis.

""The city is being radically reconfigured -- the whole Bay Area is,"" said urban geography expert and UC Berkeley professor emeritus Richard Walker. ""The Oakland we knew is not going to remain.""

The change is particularly stark in Oakland, where developers and investors began clamoring to build after decades of dismissing the city as dangerous and crime-rid-den. Oakland has permitted a staggering 9,710 new homes since 2016, more than twice as many as during the prior nine years. But the construction of those new dwellings -- creating hip, trendy neighborhoods for newcomers while pricing out old-timers -- is exacerbating the divide between the city's haves and have-nots.

Other cities are struggling with the same tensions.

In East Palo Alto, long thought of as the blue-collar cousin to ritzy Palo Alto, the median sale price of a home has risen 80 percent since 2015, according to Zillow. In parts of downtown San Jose, low-income residents fear the proposed Google campus of 20,000 employees will price them out. And in San Francisco, an influx of tech companies and their workers has helped push rents into the stratosphere, driving some residents to Oakland in search of cheaper housing -- which in turn inflates rents in the East Bay city.

Adam Kleinberg, who moved from San Francisco eight years ago in search of cheaper housing, has enjoyed watching his new town change around him.

""The moment I moved here, the nightlife downtown started to take off,"" said 47-year-old Kleinberg, who runs an advertising agency in San Francisco and owns a home in the Oakland Hills. ""No one goes to the city anymore, because there's so much going on in Oakland. It's definitely becoming hipper and cooler.""

The building boom is altering Oakland's skyline, ushering in a new wave of high-rise apartment buildings. Towers in the works include a 33-story building at Broadway and 17th Street, a 40-story building at 1314 Franklin St., and a 23-story building on Webster Street. Construction crews broke ground in May on the 24-story Skylyne at Temescal tower next to the MacArthur BART station.

Those developers have a big incentive to build -- Oakland rents have spiked nearly 25 percent since 2015, according to RentCafe, and home prices have jumped almost 40 percent, according to Zillow. But as projects are completed, supply should go up and prices could come down.

""Over the next three years we're finally going to see more balance between tenants and landlords, because there's going to be so much more supply coming online,"" said Michael Ghielmetti, president of Signature Development Group and Oakland director of city planning and research association SPUR.

Cities throughout the Bay Area are struggling to keep up with the demand to live here, and to make up for years of failing to build enough housing, but the amount of construction they are willing or able to approve varies widely. Oakland permitted 4,284 new homes in 2017, up from 2,121 in 2016. San Jose permitted 2,712 new homes in the 2016-2017 fiscal year, down from a five-year high of 4,724 in the 2013-2014 fiscal year. San Francisco permitted 6,731 new homes last year, a 20-year high.

But permitting is just the first step -- projects a city approves may not get built right away, or ever, if the developer runs out of funds or faces other delays. To keep pace with the demand in Oakland, developers need to build an average of 2,125 homes a year for the next eight years, according to a 2017 report by the city's Housing Cabinet. As of July 31, there were 884 homes completed so far this year.

The building boom and resulting gentrification are squeezing the city's most vulnerable. After living in Oakland his entire life, 54-year-old Marcus Emery recently found himself homeless for the first time.

His landlord died about three years ago, Emery said, and the new owner wanted to raise the rent beyond what he could pay. Emery, who already was behind in payments because of admittedly poor financial decisions, was evicted from the house in West Oakland he'd called home for almost two decades.

""It still hurts me when I go by there now,"" he said.

After spending time in one of Oakland's many sprawling homeless encampments, Emery moved into a community of Tuff Sheds the city set up on Northgate Avenue to house the homeless, and is working on finding permanent housing.

In 2016, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf promised to build 17,000 new housing units in the next eight years -- 28 percent would be subsidized, low-income housing -- and preserve another 17,000 existing homes as low-income rentals. So far, Oakland is on track to meet its overall goal, but is falling short in its affordable housing mandate. Of the 6,982 new units under construction as of July 31, less than 6 percent were reserved for low-income residents.

Oakland officials say they have to work harder to find money for affordable housing. In 2011, the state axed redevelopment agencies, depriving Oakland of about $37 million a year in affordable housing funds, said Housing and Community Development Director Michele Byrd.

The city has found new sources of funding -- including a real estate fee approved by state legislators last year, affordable housing bonds and an affordable housing impact fee that took effect in Oakland in 2016 -- but has yet to come up with a ""cash cow"" to replace redevelopment agency funds, Byrd said. The city also has expanded its focus to include buying existing buildings and keeping them affordable, working with organizations like Oakland Community Land Trust, in addition to building new units.

Oakland needs affordable housing now perhaps more than ever, as high prices push more families out of their homes and onto the streets. Last year there were 2,761 homeless people counted in Oakland, up more than 25 percent from 2015, according to EveryOne Home's point-in-time survey.

""I go from a block where there are tents lining the sidewalk, to a block where there are Teslas and Mercedes lining the sidewalk,"" said Osha Neumann, a staff attorney with the East Bay Community Law Center. ""It's almost like we're dividing into two species. And it's increasingly difficult for people to move from the streets, from the bottom, anywhere up away from there.""

Zane Burton, who moved to Oakland after getting priced out of San Francisco about seven years ago, now worries rent increases will push him out of Oakland, too. As prices go up, Burton, who is African-American, says everyone who looks like him is leaving his Lake Merritt neighborhood.

It's not just Lake Merritt -- Oakland's black population is shrinking. In 2007, African-American residents made up nearly 33 percent of Oakland's population, according to census data. By 2016, that had dropped to less than 24 percent.

Burton is determined to stay. ""Lake Merritt is the last frontier,"" Burton said. ""After Lake Merritt, people of color will have to go out to East Oakland, where there's fighting, shooting, you can't let your kid be on the porch. And then it's just a matter of time before the rent in East Oakland gets high.""",347,George Avalos,13-Sep-18,Housing Tower Slated To Sprout Near San Jose Train Station,500,The East Bay Times (california),,"Housing Tower Slated To Sprout Near San Jose Train Station

HIGHLIGHT:еКProject developers Republic Urban and Swenson have bought an empty lot where they intend to build a 120-unit, 10-story residential project that would rise next to the identical Skyline at Tamien apartment complex.

SAN JOSE  A new residential tower is in the works for a vacant field next to the Tamien train station south of downtown San Jose, now that the developers have bought the land they need for the project.

Republic Urban and Swenson, the projects developers, have bought an empty lot where they intend to build a 120-unit, 10-story residential project that will rise next to the identical Skyline at Tamien apartment complex.

We think the market is very ripe for this type of product, said Michael Van Every, president of Republic Urban. Home ownership is really needed in the region.

Acting through an affiliate, GR Tamien, the developers paid $2.8 million on June 15 for about 1.2 acres of land on Lick Avenue between West Alma Avenue and Floyd Street.

We will probably break ground late in 2019, said Konstantin Voronin, land acquisition director with Republic Urban.

San Jose city officials have already approved this phase of the development, which would be the twin of the first building. The current south tower of Skyline at Tamien fronts on Alma Avenue between Lick Avenue and the adjacent train tracks, with the freeway just a bit further west.

The Skyline towers development is right next to transit, Van Every said. We think thats something we are well-positioned to take advantage of.

Republic Urban is bullish enough about the development potential in the area that it has proposed an even larger residential project a short distance north and also near the train station.

The adjacent and larger project would consist of 568 residential units and 3,000 square feet of retail, according to planning documents on file with the city of San Jose.еКRepublic Urban and The Core Companies are co-developers of this nearby residential project, which would replace an existing surface parking lot for the transit station.

The Tamien station is just a few rail stops from downtown San Joses Diridon Station transit hub, which serves light rail, Caltrain, Amtrak, the ACE Train, Capitol Corridor line and buses. So that means residents of these projects could reach work and entertainment destinations in downtown San Jose and other cities just by hopping on one of the trains at Tamien.

Plus, more tech companies are eyeing downtown San Jose for future offices, or are actively planning expansions in the urban heart of the Bay Areas largest city.

You have Google, Adobe and other employers moving into the downtown, so the demand for housing is also going to increase, Voronin said.

San Jose-based Adobe has proposed a major expansion of its downtown headquarters site that would add a fourth office tower next to the existing three-building campus.

Mountain View-based Google plans to develop a transit-oriented community of office buildings, residences, shops, restaurants and open spaces near the Diridon train station in downtown San Jose where 15,000 to 20,000 of its employees would eventually work.

Its probably a good time to diversify by building more projects with homes that are for sale, Van Every said.",348,George Avalos,10-Sep-18,Downtown San Jose Hotel Plans To Expand At Choice Site,463,The East Bay Times (california),,"Downtown San Jose Hotel Plans To Expand At Choice Site

SAN JOSE - Plans have expanded for a hotel tower that would sprout on a choice site in downtown San Jose, a short distance from a planned Adobe Systems campus expansion and proposed Google transit village.

A 19-story hotel being eyed for 8 N. Almaden Blvd. and West Santa Clara Street in San Jose originally was expected to have 220 rooms. But a newly submitted set of proposals by project developer KT Urban calls for a 272-room hotel, complete with a rooftop restaurant.

""The Silicon Valley hotel market looks strong enough to support this kind of expansion,"" Alan Reay,еКpresident of Irvine-based Atlas Hospitality Group, which tracks California's lodging market, said Monday.

One reason the market is robust: Rooms in the region - and San Jose in particular - are tough to come by during the week.

""I was just talking to somebody who is developing a hotel in San Jose, and they said it's very difficult to find rooms during the week,"" Reay said.

Tech-related business travelers are driving the demand during the week, lodging experts said.

""Rooms in San Jose are going for $300 to $500 a night Monday through Thursday for business-class hotels,"" Reay said. ""Friday through Sunday, if there's not a game at Levi's Stadium, prices are usually $100 to $300 a night.""

Experts tout the proposed hotel site as a favorable location,еКwith a fresh cluster of hotels near the SAP Entertainment complex and the future Google and Adobe developments.

Just down the street, AC Hotel by Marriott opened a 210-room hotel in early 2017. A dual-brand Marriott totaling 311 rooms - and 19 for-sale residential condominiums - is being planned on the other side of the SAP Center and train station at West Julian Street and Stockton Avenue. And the 19-story hotel proposed by KT Urban would be built next to the iconic Hotel De Anza.

The new hotel tower at Almaden and Santa Clara could potentially open sometime in 2021.еКIn addition to a rooftop restaurant with the potential for far-reaching views, the new hotel would also contain a fitness center and other amenities, city planning documents show.

""This is a great location,"" said Bob Staedler, principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a land use and planning consultancy. ""It's an easy walk to the SAP arena, it's right off Highway 87. It would be part of a cluster of hotels. Hotel operators like to be near other hotels.""

Cupertino-based KT Urban didn't want to discuss the expansion plans on Monday. However, Reay suggested that the company that KT Urban anticipates would operate the hotel could have requested the 24 percent increase in the number of rooms.

""At 272 rooms, this is going to be a full service hotel,"" Reay said. ""There's a high likelihood that the hotel company's preferences were a factor behind increasing this to 272 rooms.""",349,Sal Pizarro,6-Sep-18,Google Paying To Repair Vandalized San Jose Vietnam Vets Memorial,339,The East Bay Times (california),,"Google Paying To Repair Vandalized San Jose Vietnam Vets Memorial

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe monument to San Jose's fallen Vietnam veterans stands close to the Diridon Station area where Google aims to build its campus.

A donation from Google will cover the cost of repairing the Vietnam veterans' memorial in San Jose which was vandalized two weeks ago. The price tag to repair the Sons of San Jose monument is estimated at $2,500 to $3,000 - a relatively small amount for the search engine giant - but it could return much larger dividends in community goodwill.

The veterans memorial is in the Guadalupe River Park, close to both SAP Center and the Diridon Station area where Google is aiming to build a campus for up to 20,000 workers. In a statement, Google Public Policy Manager Javier Gonzalez said the company was ""proud to lend a hand as a corporate citizen of San Jose by funding the restoration and preservation of this important local monument.""

After the memorial was defaced by graffiti, the San Jose Parks Foundation received a few hundred dollars in donations to restore it. Google's gift - the exact amount was not specified - put the campaign over the top and will also provide funding for future maintenance of the monument, which honors the 142 San Jose residents who lost their lives in the Vietnam War.

Dennis and Sandra Fernandez, speaking on behalf of the board of the San Jose VietnamеКWar Memorial Foundation, released a statement thanking Google and everyone else who contributed.

""This gesture is moreеКthan a financial contribution; it is validation that our memorial's existence is sacred to itsеКcommunity,"" they said.

Google's gesture also drew praise from San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo and City Councilman Raul Peralez, in whose district the memorial stands. San Jose Parks Foundation Executive Director James Reber said Google has been very supportive of the foundation's work on behalf of San Jose's green spaces.

The company has actually been steadily increasing its community involvement in San Jose, providing grants to East Side community organizations like SOMOS Mayfair and Veggielution and sponsoring big events including San Jose Jazz Summer Fest and WorldCon 76, the huge science fiction gathering held in downtown last month.",350,"Jason Green, Robert Salonga",22-Aug-18,"Gunman Holds Up San Jose State Student, Forces Atm Withdrawals",404,The East Bay Times (california),,"Gunman Holds Up San Jose State Student, Forces Atm Withdrawals

According to San Jose police  which is being assisted by university police in the investigation  a male student was at the 7-Eleven at Sixth Sixth and East San Salvador streets around 2:40 p.m. Wednesday when another man approached him and brandished a gun.

The gunman reportedly accompanied the student to several ATMs in downtown San Jose and forced him to withdraw cash, police said. After multiple stops, the suspect left the victim, who then went home and called police after encouragement from his roommate.

No arrest had been reported as of Thursday afternoon. Police described the suspect as a man in his 20s with a dark complexion, yellow-dyed hair, last seen wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, black sweatpants with a white stripe, and a gray JAMZ-brand backpack.

HIGHLIGHT:еКGary Dillabough, a realty entrepreneur and venture capitalist who has taken on the development or rehabilitation of several high-profile projects in downtown San Jose, is in the final stages of completing a purchase of at least the vast majority of the Valley Title block.

SAN JOSE  One of downtown San Joses choice properties, Valley Title, is being eyed by a developer who already has taken on some key projects in the area.

Gary Dillabough, a realty entrepreneur and venture capitalist who has taken on the development or rehabilitation of several high-profile projects in downtown San Jose, is in the final stages of completing a purchase of the vast majority of the Valley Title block, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the transaction.

The purchase by the Dillabough-led group is expected to be completed by the end of August, some of the people said.

The block is bounded by East San Carlos, South First, East San Salvador and South Second streets. The site is a property that could bolster ongoing upgrades of downtown San Jose and buttress activity in the SoFA neighborhood, an arts, entertainment and nightlife section of downtown.

Its a critical location, said Scott Knies, executive director of the San Jose Downtown Association. Its the gateway to the SoFA. Its a link on San Carlos between the university and the rest of the downtown.

The surface parking lot, in the shape of a T, along with the vacant Valley Title building at the corner of South First and East San Carlos, would offer a developer enough acreage for a flexible array of site projects.

You could do high density, mixed uses, pretty much any combination of retail, residential, hotels and offices, said Kim Walesh, the citys economic development director. A lot could be done on a site of that size.

For years, observers of downtown San Jose had wondered whether a developer might step forward to obtain the property.

Dillabough is hardly a surprise choice, having acquired numerous properties in downtown San Jose. That is seen as one of the drivers behind an emerging transformation of the downtown San Jose skyline, complete with major new office tenants, thousands of new residents, and more restaurants, shops and night spots.

Dillabough declined to comment for this report.

Investment ventures led by Dillabough are actively upgrading buildings, such as the Bank of Italy office tower and nearby Bank of the West building, both historic high rises at the corner of Santa Clara and South First streets, as well as the Moir Building on North First Street. Dillabough also has bought adjacent properties on East Santa Clara Street between First and Second streets; a South Second Street parking lot, behind the Bank of Italy building, that is ripe for future development; and an office building at 153 N. Third St.

Dillabough also is undertaking an ambitious project on Park Avenue known as Museum Place, which likely would feature a big office complex and an expansion of The Tech Museum of Innovation.

Beyond Dillaboughs efforts are other major development plans, such as Googles transit village proposal near the Diridon train station, a nearby 1 million-square-foot tech campus planned by TMG Partners and Valley Oaks Partners, and the Adobe Systems proposal to expand its three-building downtown headquarters by adding a fourth office tower that could accommodate 3,000 of its workers.

The development interest in downtown San Jose is ramping up, said Bob Staedler, principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a land-use and planning consultancy. A lot of important properties that have been stuck for decades are finally breaking free to new owners who will do something with them. Its exciting to see whats happening.",352,The Washington Post,18-Aug-18,Google Refused Order To Release Data; Will Other Companies Bow Under Pressure?,1269,The East Bay Times (california),,"Google Refused Order To Release Data; Will Other Companies Bow Under Pressure?

HIGHLIGHT:еКIn an age where virtually everyone carries a phone at nearly every moment of the day, devices have a trove of data for law enforcement to look to.

By Deanna Paul | Washington Post

It was a case that gave a new meaning to the phrase ""Google search.""

Earlier this year, a federal judge signed a search warrant for a windfall of private information to help find the robber responsible for a string of crimes in southern Maine.

Authorities were seeking a large amount of sensitive user data - including names, addresses and location, as first reported by Forbes - of anyone who had been in the vicinity of at least two of the nine robbery locations, within 30 minutes of the crime.

The Associated Press reports Google apps can collect data even when users have turned off location services on their phones, so the potential number of people covered by the warrant was vast. Still, without knowing whom the warrant was looking for or whether the suspect even used a Google device, a federal judge signed the warrant March 30.

Start your day with the news you need from the Bay Area and beyond. Sign up for our Morning Report weekday newsletter.

The warrant ordered Google to turn over all sought data, whether a user was carrying an Android phone or running a Google app at the time, a move that has alarmed some privacy and Fourth Amendment experts worried that warrants with very broad scopes will become a new norm for police investigations.

""Where big data policing and data trails are available it becomes tempting, and maybe too tempting, to take shortcuts with process that should be used as a last resort,"" Andrew Ferguson, a criminal law attorney and author of ""The Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance, Race, and the Future of Law Enforcement,"" told The Washington Post. He pointed to all the people bound to be swept up in such dragnet searches.

The government's warrant was written by the U.S. attorney's office in the District of Maine to assist in catching the perpetrator, according to the document: ""[I]nformation stored in connection with an email account may provide crucial evidence of the 'who, what, why, when, where, and how' of the criminal conduct under investigation, thus enabling the United States to establish and prove each element or alternatively, to exclude the innocent from further suspicion.""

According to Ferguson, the facts of each robbery, laid out by officials in the warrant application, did not make clear what they were looking for. The suspect had committed seven successful armed robberies and botched two attempts, targeting local gas stations, convenience stores and Chinese restaurants. The perpetrator was usually, though not consistently, described as white, wearing a dark hoodie and covering the lower half of his face. All of the mentioned crimes spanned late March.

""It's like they were trying to lump them all together and draw threads using digital trails,"" Ferguson said.

Google's first court-ordered deadline arrived on April 23, but the U.S. attorney's office had not received anything. It asked for an extension to afford the company more time, Assistant United States Attorney Michael Conley said to The Post. Five months and three extensions later, his office gave up. ""We were pursuing every possible angle,"" Conley said.

By that point, though, Conley didn't need Google's assistance. The suspect, Travis Card, had been arrested months earlier in an armed robbery of a country gas station in Westbrook, Maine.

It is unclear whether Google, which could not be reached for immediate comment, failed to respond to the warrant in an attempt to thwart law enforcement and protect user privacy or because it couldn't locate the information. But the incident appears to be an example of corporations struggling with how to position themselves in relation to law enforcement.

In an age where virtually everyone carries a phone at nearly every moment of the day, devices have a trove of data for law enforcement to look to - map applications, WiFi hotspots, cell-tower triangulations, images with embedded locations.

People should not have to rely on tech companies to make discretionary decisions about whether to protect such personal data, said Nathan Freed Wessler, a staff attorney at the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. Instead, he said, sensitive information should be protected by strong laws and judges' strong enforcement of the Constitution.

""The only real way we're going to avoid unnecessary dragnet searches is to have protections in place. It may be appropriate in exceptional circumstances or where other avenues are exhausted, but there are lots of other ways to build leads and find suspects,"" said Wessler, drawing a comparison to wiretaps, which are also not the first option in criminal investigations. Courts require a showing that they are, in fact, a necessary tactic. The same, he said, should be true of data searches that can sweep up other people.

Some technology companies have tried to argue these requests are fishing expeditions, though as service providers they often have little ground to stand on in court. Facebook fought New York prosecutors, losing the battle to block bulk search warrants in 2017. Last year, Amazon.com was ordered to turn over any data collected during an alleged murder. Though the company satisfied part of the warrant, it filed a motion to void the rest, calling the warrant excessive. Like Card's case, Amazon's compliance eventually became moot.

(Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, owns The Washington Post.)

Apple famously fought a court order to assist federal investigators in developing software to break the PIN code of San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook's iPhone.

Many corporations have updated guidelines to inform users when they receive court orders for information. To counter this, law enforcement has been tacking gag orders onto warrants that forbid the named company from disclosing their existence. Google could not disclose there was a warrant for 180 days.

Although Conley would not comment on how often the federal government uses data-driven warrants in criminal investigations, some experts are convinced it's already happening regularly.

""One of the things that isn't getting enough attention is that this is going to be the new norm for police investigations. We need to educate police, prosecutors, judges and defendants about how to appropriately request the digital trails,"" Ferguson said.

And, as in Card's case, broad warrants are not always necessary. ""Old-fashioned detective work can be just as effective. Now we're talking about what these kinds of warrants should look like and the need to analyze the specificity,"" Ferguson said.

Nondigital police work led authorities to Card in the months after the judge signed the warrant. Publicly circulated surveillance videos were played on local news and posted to the Portland Police Department's social media pages. These led to eye witness accounts, and a search of Card's house uncovered a black sweatshirt and BB pistol.

Fresh policies needed for country to become more focused on growing the pie for everyone

One of the most enjoyable elements of my job is travelling to countries where the companies we invest in are based. Travel is an important part of our fund's bottom-up investment process because we need to build on-the-ground knowledge of the companies we invest in to avoid making errors that can cost our clients money.

By far the best way of doing this is to meet company management at their head offices (as opposed to meeting them at a conference) in-country, because one can monopolise the full time allotted to you with them and learn softer details about their respective companies.

We recently completed a trip to the US west coast, with Silicon Valley companies demanding the bulk of our attention. The electric pace of technological advancement in this region highlighted some hard truths regarding the shortcomings of our own local industries and broader economy.

In a world that is progressing away from agriculture and manufacturing towards one where it is increasingly the owners of intellectual property who are collecting the greatest rents, SA looks to be falling hopelessly behind.

The name Silicon Valley, which was coined in the early 1970s and used to reference the number of silicon-chip manufacturers in the Santa Clara Valley, has come to refer to the entire San Francisco Bay area, where many of the US's best tech businesses are based.

Silicon Valley has managed to attract some of the brightest tech minds in the world because it offers entrepreneurs the opportunity to strike out on their own and start the next Facebook (or Amazon or Google). Part of this opportunity lies in the slew of venture-capital funding waiting to ride on the coat-tails of the & next big idea& It is no exaggeration to say that should any natural disaster befall the Bay Area, which is known for its seismic activity, a significant amount of the world's intellectual capital is at risk of being lost. This combination of brilliant minds and venture-capital funding has naturally also led to a booming economy: the San Jose municipality within the Bay Area has the third-largest GDP per capita in the world at $127,000, after Zug in Switzerland and Oslo in Norway.

TECH CAMPUSES

Of the Faangs (the acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), we visited the Apple and Google campuses. While the Google campus has the collegiate atmosphere of a university, the impressiveness of the newly built Apple campus, whose building budget of $5bn roughly equates to the market cap of Mr Price, was eclipsed by Apple's secretive - and perhaps even arrogant - culture, which is beginning to resemble the Microsoft of yore. Apple's closed ecosystem also contrasts with the & new& Microsoft, which has evolved from pushing its products onto its customers to allowing them to choose the solutions they want.

We also visited a number of specialised software businesses whose dizzying growth is testament to what is possible when bright minds with big dreams are married with funding.

These companies included enterprise software-as-a-service firms such as ServiceNow (founded in 2004, now with a $30bn market cap) and Veeva (founded in 2008 and now worth $10bn).

Finally, we met a number of companies that, while not well known, have very large market shares within the niches they compete in and would fall within the realm of what we would label & good businesses& because they have entrenched competitive advantages (what Warren Buffett calls & moats& and consequently generate outsized cash (not just accounting) returns.

This list includes companies such as Cadence Design, which sells electronic design automation systems (a computer-aided design program for semiconductors); Maxim, which participates in the analogue semiconductor market, a small but necessary part of the massive overall semiconductor market; and the more & old-world& Omnicell, which builds automatic dispensing units and software for the health-care sector.

The success of the trip allowed us to meet a large number of businesses we would like to own should they trade at the right price, even if they may not be trading at those levels currently. Investing, after all, is a long game.

However, these company meetings made it difficult not to draw unfavourable comparisons with SA.

For example, sales of the Apple iPhone, one of the bestselling products in the world, totalled $144bn in 2017, almost half the size of SA's nominal GDP. Apple makes gross profits on this item of $56bn, greater than three times the value of all the commodities used to produce it (which total $18bn).

As a commodity exporter, SA would battle it out for a portion of that $18bn and the gross profits SA corporates could earn would be a fraction of the commodity value they had managed to supply.

While this example paints a picture of the future that is gloomier than the reality, it is clear that today SA is on the wrong side of this global shift towards new industries.

It is my hope that our policy priorities shift away from redistributing portions of an ever-diminishing pie to one that can evolve with the changing times we find ourselves in and become more focused on growing the pie for everyone.

It will not help to cry foul when the inevitable does eventually manifest.

ings - creating hip, trendy neighborhoods for newcomers while pricing out old-timers - is exacerbating the divide between the city's haves and have-nots. Other cities are struggling with the same tensions.

In East Palo Alto, long thought of as the blue-collar cousin to ritzy Palo Alto, the median sale price of a house has risen 80 percent since 2015, according to Zillow. In parts of downtown San Jose, low-income residents fear the proposed Google campus of 20,000 employees will price them out. And in San Francisco, an influx of tech companies and their workers has helped push rents into the stratosphere, driving some residents to Oakland in search of cheaper housing - which in turn inflates rents in the East Bay city.

Adam Kleinberg, who moved from San Francisco eight years ago in search of cheaper housing, has enjoyed watching his new town change around him.

""The moment I moved here, the nightlife downtown started to take off,"" said 47-year-old Kleinberg, who runs an advertising agency in San Francisco and owns a home in the Oakland Hills. ""No one goes to the city anymore, because there's so much going on in Oakland. It's definitely becoming hipper and cooler.""

The building boom is altering Oakland's skyline, ushering in a new wave of high-rise apartment buildings. Towers in the works include a 33-story building at Broadway and 17th Street, a 40-story building at 1314 Franklin St. and a 23-story building on Webster Street. Construction crews broke ground in May on the 24-story Skylyne at Temescal tower next to the MacArthur BART station.

Developers have a big incentive to build - Oakland rents have spiked nearly 25 percent since 2015, according to RentCafe, and home prices have jumped almost 40 percent, according to Zillow. But as projects are completed, supply should go up and prices could come down.

""Over the next three years, we're finally going to see more balance between tenants and landlords, because there's going to be so much more supply coming online,"" said Michael Ghielmetti, president of Signature Development Group and Oakland director of city planning and research association SPUR.

Cities throughout the Bay Area are struggling to keep up with the demand to live here and to make up for years of failing to build enough housing, but the amount of construction they are willing or able to approve varies widely. Oakland permitted 4,284 new homes in 2017, up from 2,121 in 2016. San Jose permitted 2,712 new homes in the 2016-2017 fiscal year, down from a five-year high of 4,724 in the 2013-2014 fiscal year. San Francisco permitted 6,731 new homes last year, a 20-year high.

But permitting is just the first step; projects a city approves may not get built right away, or ever, if the developer runs out of funds or faces other delays.

To keep pace with the demand in Oakland, developers need to build an average of 2,125 homes a year for the next eight years, according to a 2017 report by the city's Housing Cabinet. As of July 31, there were 884 homes completed so far this year.

The building boom and resulting gentrification are squeezing the city's most vulnerable. After living in Oakland his entire life, 54-year-old Marcus Emery recently found himself homeless for the first time. His landlord died about three years ago, Emery said, and the new owner wanted to raise the rent beyond what he could pay. Emery, who already was behind in payments because of admittedly poor financial decisions, was evicted from the house in West Oakland he'd called home for almost two decades.

""It still hurts me when I go by there now,"" he said.

After spending time in one of Oakland's many sprawling homeless encampments, Emery moved into a community of Tuff Sheds the city set up on Northgate Avenue to house the homeless, and he's working on finding permanent housing.

Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf promised to build 17,000 new housing units in the next eight years - 28 percent would be subsidized low-income housing - and preserve another 17,000 existing homes as low-income rentals. So far, Oakland is on track to meet its overall goal but is falling short in its affordable housing mandate. Of the 6,982 new units under construction as of July 31, less than 6 percent were reserved for low-income residents.

Oakland officials say they have to work harder to find money for affordable housing. In 2011, the state axed redevelopment agencies, depriving Oakland of about $37 million a year in affordable housing funds, said Housing and Community Development Director Michele Byrd.

The city has found new sources of funding - including a real estate fee approved by state legislators last year, affordable housing bonds and an affordable housing impact fee that took effect in Oakland in 2016 - but has yet to come up with a ""cash cow"" to replace redevelopment agency funds, Byrd said. The city also has expanded its focus to include buying existing buildings and keeping them affordable, working with organizations like Oakland Community Land Trust, in addition to building new units.

Oakland needs affordable housing now perhaps more than ever, as high prices push more families out of their homes and onto the streets. Last year, 2,761 homeless people were counted in Oakland, up more than 25 percent from 2015, according to EveryOne Home's point-in-time survey.

""I go from a block where there are tents lining the sidewalk, to a block where there are Teslas and Mercedes lining the sidewalk,"" said Osha Neumann, a staff attorney with the East Bay Community Law Center. ""It's almost like we're dividing into two species. And it's increasingly difficult for people to move from the streets, from the bottom, anywhere up away from there.""

Zane Burton, who moved to Oakland after getting priced out of San Francisco about seven years ago, now worries rent increases will push him out of Oakland. As prices go up, Burton, who is African-American, says everyone who looks like him is leaving his Lake Merritt neighborhood.

It's not just Lake Merritt - Oakland's black population is shrinking.

In 2007, African-American residents made up nearly 33 percent of Oakland's population, according to census data. By 2016, that had dropped to less than 24 percent.

Burton is determined to stay.

""Lake Merritt is the last frontier,"" he said. ""After Lake Merritt, people of color will have to go out to East Oakland, where there's fighting, shooting, you can't let your kid be on the porch. And then it's just a matter of time before the rent in East Oakland gets high.""

Burton, who gets paid twice a month as a mental health worker, said an entire paycheck goes toward rent every month. Even so, he's feeling pressure to move out from a landlord he suspects wants to charge more. Burton said his wife recently found an eviction notice taped to their front door, falsely accusing the family of failing to pay the rent. He got the matter cleared up, but it was scary, he said. Now Burton is fighting a $65 rent increase - a relatively small amount that nevertheless would eat into the family's budget, he said. And if this hike goes through, Burton worries larger increases might not be far behind.

The fast-paced changes also are troubling for some of Oakland's small business owners.

While some people worry their neighborhoods are changing too quickly, others fret that the city's building boom will slow down before it can make a dent in the housing shortage. As construction costs soar, some builders are hitting the brakes. Three years ago, it cost about $350,000 per unit to build a residential project in downtown Oakland, said real estate developer John Protopappas, president and CEO of Madison Park Financial Corporation. Now it's closer to $585,000. And impact fees - the amount developers of market-rate units pay toward Oakland's affordable housing budget - are rising. Developers of multifamily buildings paid $7,000 per downtown unit in 2016, which rose to $13,000 last year and jumped to $24,000 in July.

Meanwhile, though rents are high, the speed at which they are increasing has slowed. That discrepancy can leave developers struggling to make their buildings profitable.

Pam Davis, who has lived in Oakland since 1961, is spending her golden years fretting about housing. The 63-year-old rents a one-bedroom apartment near Lake Merritt, and though her unit is rent-controlled, as prices rise around her, she worries that won't protect her forever.

""I've got all this uncertainty here, at a vulnerable time,"" Davis said. ""It's saddening, and it makes you a little angry.""

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe database and a new report from Google come in response to pressure for tech giants to be more transparent about political ad spending after Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.

With November just around the corner  and a spotlight on how tech giants are handling elections  Google has rolled out a way to track spending on political ads that run on its massive platform.

The top spender so far? The Trump Make America Great Again Committee, which has paid $629,500 since May for 1,321 ads, according to Googles database. The database shows all the ad campaigns the committee has bought, and provides details on how much each ad cost, how long it ran and the number of impressions it had.

Google also added a new political-advertising section to its biannual transparency report.

Our goal is to provide information that helps everyone better understand how political advertising works online, the company announced Wednesday.

Besides showing the top ad spenders, that information also includes amount spent in each congressional district and top advertising keywords.

Florida tops all states in political ad spending so far during this election season, with $1.1 million, as Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson faces a tough battle for reelection there. His name also shows up among the top ad keywords, along with ACLU, Rep. Diane Black, R-Tennessee, and others.

Tech giants are under pressure to be more transparent about political ad spending after strong evidence showing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The United States has charged the Internet Research Agency  which bought ads on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, the companies have confirmed  and others with running an online troll farm with the purpose of interfering in the election.

Now, tech giants are requiring proof of U.S. citizenship or legal residency before they sell political ads to them, and taking other action. Googles release of its ad database comes after Facebook launched its archive of political ads in May, and Twitter introduced its ad transparency center in June.

HIGHLIGHT:еКActing through an affiliate, Jay Paul on Aug. 13 paid $46 million in cash for a 120,000-square-foot building at the corner of North First and West Santa Clara streets that once was a JCPenney department store.

SAN JOSE - Developer Jay Paul, whose major Silicon Valley tenants include Facebook, Amazon and Google, has expanded its San Jose footprint by grabbing an office building located at a key downtown intersection.

Acting through an affiliate called SJ North 1st, Jay Paul on Aug. 13 bought a historic building at North First and West Santa Clara streets, according to Santa Clara County property records. The 120,000-square-foot building once was a long-time JCPenney department store in the retail heyday of downtown San Jose, but closed in 1973 amid an exodus of merchants to the city's suburban malls.

This deal means realty developer Jay Paul has suddenly become a big-time player in downtown San Jose, spending just under $330 million in cash in two major acquisitions of prominent commercial properties over a stretch of only three weeks.

""Jay Paul's burgeoning investment in downtown ratchets the slope of San Jose's trajectory another degree upward,"" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said Wednesday. ""It's reaffirming to see that Jay recognizes downtown's potential as Silicon Valley's city center.""

In the most recent deal, the Jay Paul entity paid $46 million for the old JCPenney building. On July 23, the developer paid $283.5 million for Cityview Plaza, a 580,000-square-foot complex of offices, retailers and restaurants that occupies a full city block bounded by West San Fernando Street, South Almaden Boulevard, Park Avenue and South Market Street.

""Jay Paul is a whole new level of developer for downtown San Jose,"" said Scott Knies, executive director of the San Jose Downtown Association. ""They have a vision for imagining big projects, and Cityview and this block are both big projects.""

The latest purchase by Jay Paul is a building that is undergoing a far-ranging renovation masterminded by realty firm Lift Partners. Lift paid $17.6 million for the building in 2016 and has obtained $39.3 million in financing to bankroll the renovation. It wasn't clear what effect, if any, the purchase would have on the building's facelift.еКNeither development firm responded to requests for a comment.

""This is what downtown San Jose needs,"" said Bob Staedler, principal executive with San Jose-based Silicon Valley Synergy, a land-use and planning consultancy. ""San Jose is getting developers who will create large portfolios, improve the buildings and get tenants in the buildings.""

In an effort headed by Mayor Liccardo, San Jose officials hope to lure a variety of technology companies to the city's increasingly vibrant urban core.

Adobe Systems is already in downtown San Jose and wants to expand its headquarters campus of three office towers by adding a fourth high-rise. Google is pushing forward with plans for a transit-oriented community of office buildings, restaurants, shops, housing and park lands near the Diridon train station. Oracle has a large presence in an office tower at the south end of downtown. Amazon occupies two floors in an office tower near the corner of East Santa Clara and North Second streets. A host of small tech firms have moved to downtown or expanded there in recent years.

Jay Paul's recent San Jose investments could help to usher more tech companies - potentially major household names - into the city's downtown, if its experience in attracting tenants in nearby Sunnyvale is anything to go by.

Facebook in March leased 1 million square feet from Jay Paul in the developer's Moffett Towers 2 office complex in Sunnyvale - the largest leasing deal in the Bay Area so far in 2018.

Other big tech companies that are Jay Paul tenants in Sunnyvale: Amazon's Lab 126 occupies multiple Jay Paul-developed buildings, and Google leases large office buildings from the developer.

""When you look at the price paid for this building (in San Jose), and the extraordinary tenant list that Jay Paul has, you have to believe that one of these will be the tenant,"" said Mark Ritchie, president of Ritchie Commercial, a real estate brokerage. ""These kinds of moves are the sorts of investments that developers were not making in downtown San Jose just a few years ago.""",358,George Avalos,14-Aug-18,"Google San Jose Village Advisory Group Ponders Projects Impacts For Housing,",830,The Mercury News (california),,"Google San Jose Village Advisory Group Ponders Projects Impacts For Housing,

HIGHLIGHT:еКJobs for all income levels and additional housing for local residents were themes that dominated a meeting of the Station Area Advisory Group, a citizen panel attempting to compile community input and craft ways Google could develop a transit-oriented community near the Diridon train station.

SAN JOSE  A need for more affordable housing and a wide range of well-paying jobs tied to Googles proposed downtown San Jose mega-campus dominated the discussion Monday night at an advisory group meeting about the projects likely impacts.

The meeting was the first public airing before the Station Area Advisory Group of findings about the publics concerns over the projects potential impacts.

The prospect of thousands of well-paid Google employees further boosting already lofty housing prices in the area and potentially displacing residents needs to be addressed in the planning, presenters told the advisory group, whichеКis gathering community input to guide the development. The proposed Google transit village would bring offices, homes, shops, restaurants and open spaces near the Diridon train station, where the search giant would employ 15,000 to 20,000 people.

There has been a lot of discussion about the links between jobs and housing, said Dave Javid, principal executive with Plan to Place, and a consultant to the Station Area Advisory Group, in presenting to the advisory group a summary of priorities raised by the public. The idea is to be sure that lower-wage workers can find a place to live here.

According to a summary of public priorities presented to the panel by Lori Severino, civic engagement program manager for the Diridon Station Area, At least 25 percent of the new housing units should be affordable for moderate-, low-, very low- and extremely low-income residents.

The public also wants to maximize high-density housing in the Diridon Station Area, as well in other transit corridors, including east San Jose, according to Severinos summary.

A city staff report in 2014, well before Google started buying property in downtown San Jose in December 2016, estimated that potentially 2,600 residential units could be built in the immediate vicinity of the Diridon Station and SAP Center. The report is the most recent available regarding the transit station district.

The stakes are enormous as San Jose officials, along with Google, attempt to fashion a project that bolsters the citys economy without creating headaches for residents.

We have heard loudly and clearly that the community is concerned about the potential impact Google coming into the downtown could have on housing affordability and displacement issues that San Jose and other cities in the area have been experiencing, said Kim Walesh, San Joses economic development director. We also have heard loudly and clearly the excitement over the vitality and amenities and the even stronger downtown that would be greeted by developing the Diridon area in a cohesive, master-planned manner.

Some see the employment opportunities associated with the project as a boon for the area.

We are very excited for the jobs to come, said Nathan Ho, a Silicon Valley Leadership Group official and an advisory group member. We are excited about the opportunities for an already vibrant downtown San Jose.

Yet those same remarkable changes, if they materialize, could also force some people out of downtown San Jose due to gentrification and rising home prices, some panelists and community advocates warned.

Google attempted to reassure them that the company is listening to their concerns.

The first six months of the citys public engagement, and our own community meetings, have clarified the aspirations and concerns for future development as it relates to housing, displacement and job opportunities in San Jose, said Javier Gonzalez, a Google public affairs manager. We'll continue to participate in these open dialogues and work with the community and city over the coming years to address these priorities together.

Some panelists said they believe unfair expectations are being placed on Google simply because of its massive size and profits.

Its absurd to put all of these things on Google, said Charlie Faas, chief financial officer with San Jose State University.

Others agreed that Google cant be a panacea.

Its not fair to ask Google to solve all of our problems, said Karen Gillette, a San Jose resident, in comments to the panel. The city needs to step up, too.

Some in the audience, however, said the real problem is the lack of details more than a year after the city of San Jose first voted to launch negotiations with Google regarding the development.

People are not opposed to Google, they are opposed to Google without a plan, said Huy Tran, a San Jose resident.

Jeffrey Buchanan, director of policy and research with Working Partnerships USA, and an advisory group member, believes its entirely possible to balance the often-conflicting goals of a development in order to benefit local residents, workers, the city and the company alike, and to ensure the project doesnt create a community of haves and have nots.

We dont want a tale of two cities in San Jose, Buchanan said. Yes, people want to see Google come here, but we also want a good project. The two dont have to be pitted against each other.",359,Matthew Niksa,8-Aug-18,Downtown San Jose Hotel And Condo Development Secures Dual Marriott Brands,720,Silicon Valley Business (california),,"Downtown San Jose Hotel And Condo Development Secures Dual Marriott Brands

A pair of Marriott International brands will operate a proposed, first-of-its-kind hotel and condo development near the Diridon Station area in downtown San Jose, according toеКan adviser to the project's developer.

The project is unique for San Jose's booming downtown core because it pairs hospitality and residential space.

ErikеКSchoennauer, a land-use consultant and partner with San Jose-based SchoennauerеКCo., told the Business Journal that the Marriott brands Courtyard and Residence Inn will fly their flags on the hotel portion, which would be built on a vacant lot at 292 Stockton Ave., at the corner of West Julian Street and Stockton Avenue.

The proposal for the nine-story, 97-foot-tall project calls for 311 hotel rooms, 19 market-rate condos on the top floor, and three levels of underground parking with 175 spaces for hotel guests and 19 spaces for condo occupants.

""The hotel will fit a unique market segment for corporate and leisure travelers currently not represented in downtown, where most hotels are full service,"" SchoennauerеКsaid in an email.

Kade Development, based in Irving, Texas, is the developer of the 356,470-square-foot hotel and condo project. Oakland-based Architectural Dimensions is the project's designer and architect.

The two Marriott brands would manage the hotelеКrooms,еКbut Schoennauer said he did not know who would oversee the condo units.

The project is still awaiting approval from the City Council for for a rezoning request and also needs development and building permits before construction could begin. SchoennauerеКsaid that he is hoping the project can receive final approval from the city within 10 months so that the hotel could open as early as 2020.

The dual-branded hotel and upscale condo development in a single building would be the first of its kind in San Jose, and would also be the first new downtown hotel development on the west side of Highway 87 in decades. It would be the closest hotel to Diridon Station, the city's largest transit hub, and would be a three-minute walk from the Whole Foods Juice & Coffee Bar at 43-93 Stockton Ave., and a seven-minute walk from the SAP Center, home to the San Jose Sharks, at 525 W. Santa Clara St.

""The goal of the city (San Jose) is to create a very urban, mixed-use, pedestrian-focused community, which the west side of downtown will be in the future,""еКSchoennauerеКsaid.

Diridon Station: A hot spot for developers

Many developers in and around downtown San Jose are focusing in on the Diridon Station area because it sits in the middle of where Alphabet Inc.-owned Google and its Texas-based development partner, Trammell Crow, have been actively acquiring real estate. The two giants are moving ahead with still-broad plans for a new 8-million-square-foot urban campus that couldеКaccommodate as many as 20,000 workers.

In July, city officialsеКgranted final approvalsеКto a 1 million-square-foot office development by Bay Area developers TMG Partners and Valley Oak Partners in the same general area that Google is eyeing for its potential campus. Construction of the new three-buildingеКdevelopment at 440 West Julian St., located about half a mile from Diridon Station, is slated to begin next year and will open to tenants in 2021, according to the developers.

New hotels in San Jose's development pipeline

Amid San Jose's building boom, the city's hotel development market is also experiencing an uptick.

On July 24,еКRichmond-based Krishna Hotels San Jose, LLC submitted a site development permit application to the city of San Jose to build a new 106-room, seven-story hotel atеК605 S.еКSecondеКSt., on the corner of East Reed and South Second Streets. If approved, it would be the first hotel in the San Jose's trendyеКSoFAеКDistrict in decades.

Cupertino-based developer KT Urban submitted plans to the city in April forеКa new 19-story, 220-room glass-encased downtown hotel towerеКon what is currently a small downtown parking lot tucked next to the historic Hotel De Anza.

In the city of San Jose, there is no building that has a dual-brand hotel plus residential units,еКsaid Erik Schoennauer, principal executive and partner with Schoennauer Company, a land-use and planning consultancy that is advising the project's developer. The project will support the goals of the citys Diridon Station plan and the Alameda Urban Village plan.

The residential units would be located on the top floor of the nine-story hotel.

This development represents the first new downtown San Jose hotel developmentеКon the west side of State Route 87 in decades, according to Schoennauer. If approved, it would be the closest hotel to Diridon Station.

The hotel and residential project is being developed by Texas-based Kade Development and the designer is Oakland-based Architectural Dimensions.

The combination of hotel rooms and residences would likely make sense, said Scott Knies, executive director of the San Jose Downtown Association.

Its an intriguing concept, Knies said. The hotel rooms, the residences are compatible.

The hotel development also helps to widen the concept of the boundaries of downtown San Jose.

This will be a lot of hotel rooms, and the development would help put a stake in the ground at the northwest edges of the downtown, Knies said.

Likewise, the Google project and a nearby mega-office campus of 1 million square feet proposed by developers TMG Partners and Valley Oak Partners will, if built, create a dynamic connection between the traditional downtown core and the new frontiers on its western boundaries.

Before the hotel and housing construction could begin, the proposal would need a rezoning approved by the San Jose City Council as well as a planned development permit issued by city staffers.

The idea is to have a dense, urban, mixed-use development in a walkable, transit-oriented neighborhood, Schoennauer said.

The hotel and housing would be within a stroll of the transit station, SAP Center, the future Google transit village, the proposed Platform 16 office campus development, Whole Foods and restaurants on The Alameda.

Just down the street from the new hotel project, Googles planned development would include office buildings where 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giants employees would eventually work, along with homes, shops, restaurants and open spaces.

The California State Employment Training Panel issued the following news release:

The State of California's Employment Training Panel today announced it has supported more than 50,000 trainees through its apprenticeship training program.

""Apprenticeship programs provide employers with skilled workers and provide workers with training that can grow their income and lead to good-paying careers,"" said Employment Training Panel executive director Stewart Knox. ""In response to increased employer demand, the Employment Training Panel has grown its apprenticeship training program to fund the rigorous training required of men and women seeking career opportunities in the construction trades.""

In 2012, the Employment Training Panel began funding the classroom instruction portion of state registered apprenticeship training programs available to pre-apprentices, apprentices, and journeymen. With its awarding of 12 new construction sector apprenticeship programs worth $9 million today, the panel has awarded a total of $85 million to 174 apprenticeship training contracts supporting 50,112 trainees since the program's inception. The panel approved more than $14 million in apprenticeship training in the last fiscal year and has set aside $20 million in the current fiscal year - with $9 million awarded today - to meet increased employer demand.

Apprenticeship programs include paid on-the-job work combined with an educational or instructional component where workers earn while learning and learn by doing. Pre-apprenticeship programs prepare individuals to enter registered apprenticeship programs through industry-based training and classroom instruction. As trainees complete apprenticeship programs, they become journeymen who throughout their career may seek retraining or new skills training to meet work requirements.

The contracts awarded by the Employment Training Panel included $949,244 to the Pipe Trades Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee of Santa Clara and San Benito Counties (Pipe Trades JATC) to train 270 apprentices and journeymen in residential and commercial plumbing, steam fitting, refrigeration, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC). Recent increases in new construction projects has created high employer demand for skilled workers in the area.

""We have expanded the number of registered apprentices in our training programs to meet California's high demand for residential and commercial pipe fitters,"" said Pipe Trades JATC Director Carl Cimino. ""These funds will cover training costs and text books while creating a domino effect by freeing up portions of our budget for new training devices and building improvements that are critical to our training and growth.""

Training will take place at the Lloyd E. Williams Pipe Trades Training Center in San Jose. After training, Pipe Trades JATC apprentices and journeymen will work on a number of projects throughout Northern California that may include the Google Campus, Lucille Packard Children's Hospital, and the San Jose Airport Terminal expansion.

In total, the Employment Training Panel today approved 63 contracts worth more than $18.7 million to train 15,516 workers.

ETP is the state's premier program supporting job creation and retention through training. The panel reimburses employers for the costs of training existing workers, funds training for unemployed workers to re-enter the workforce and helps to ensure California businesses have the skilled workers they need to remain competitive.

San Jose's trendyеКSoFAеКDistrict, known for its restaurant, entertainment and nightlife scene, could soon be getting its firstеКhotel in decades.

Richmond-based Krishna Hotels San Jose, LLC, on July 24 submitted a site development permit application to the city of San Jose to build a new 106-room, seven-story hotel at 605 S.еКSecondеКSt., on the corner of East Reed and South Second Streets.

The proposed hotel, totaling 90,263 square feet, would be built on about a third of an acre, on a vacant site that Krishna Hotels owns. The property would include 39 parking spaces via two levels of below-ground parking, according to documents provided to the Silicon Valley Business Journal by Oakland-based Architectural Dimensions, the architect and designer of the project.

Krishna Hotels declined to speak on the record about its plans. The site development permit application is currently beingеКreviewedеКby city staff, according to Cassandra van DerеКZweep,еКa planner for San Jose's Department of Planning, Building, and Code Enforcement.

The hotel would be located about five blocks from the downtown San Jose McEnery Convention Center, which has in recent years hosted some of Silicon Valley's most high-profile events, including Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference and Facebook's F8 developer conference for the last two years, as well as other consumer-focused events like the Silicon Valley Comic Con.

ErikеКSchoennauer,еКa land-use consultant and partner with the San Jose-based SchoennauerеКCompany, said in a Friday phone call that the proposed hotel is the first investment in a new hotel in theеКSoFAеКDistrict in many decades. He said that this is because a part of San Jose's redevelopment plan for downtown focused on adding hotels near the convention center.

Today, thereеКare four hotels located within blocks of the center, including the Fairmont San Jose at 170 S. Market St.еКand the San Jose Marriott at 301 S. Market St.

""Even though those hotels (near the convention center) are all in place now, the downtown area still has a significant shortage of hotel rooms,""еКSchoennauer said. ""Now, investorsеКhave toеКlook for hotel opportunities at a greater distance from the convention center compared to before, i.e. three to four blocks away instead of one block away.""

SchoennauerеКsaid that the proposed hotel, if built, would anchor the southern end of theеКSoFAеКDistrict and help solve the shortage of hotel rooms in theеКSoFA District and in the downtown area.

""The city's plan for generations has been to develop the core of downtown and create a vibrant retail district,"" Schoennauer said. ""You need a large residential population for downtown to grow, and the hotels currently in the pipeline will help meet the market demand for rooms in the area.""

San Jose last year welcomed its first new hotel to its downtown core in a decade when the AC Hotel by Marriott San Jose Downtown opened at 350 W. Santa Clara St,

SchoennauerеКsaid.

SchoennauerеКsaid that he represents the Four Points by Sheraton San Jose Downtown at 211 S. First St.,еКwhich was formerly known as the Montgomery Hotel. He said that the hotel's owner, Irvine-based Khanna Enterprises,еКwantsеКto build a new high-rise hotel on the 107-year-old Montgomery Hotel site.

Last month, a group ofеКlocal businessmen submitted plans to the city of San Jose for three large new residential towersеКwith 667 residential units, plus 41,500 square feet of retail and public arts exhibition space, which includes an approximately 12,000-square-foot live performance theater.

The project, namedеКInvictaеКTowers,еКwould be located between South Second and First Streets at William Street in downtown.еКTowerеКA, the residential tower located at the corner of South Second Street and William Street, would be about 295 feet tall and 27 stories, making it the second-tallest tower in downtown. Steinberg Hart, a San Jose-based architecture and design firm, are the project architects.

Schoennauer, who is also the land-use advisor for theеКInvictaеКTowers project, said Friday that the project application is going through the city's planning entitlement and environmental review processes, which he said will take months.

All told,еКabout 100 major projects are now in San Jose's development pipeline, many of them in the downtown core and around the Diridon transit center.

Adobe SystemsеКisеКadding a new downtown office towerеКto its existing campus for about 3,000 additional workers at the same time that search giant Google is moving ahead with still-broad plans for a new 8 million-square-foot urban campus that could accommodate as many as 20,000 workers.

Earlier this month, city officials granted final approvals to a 1 million-square-foot office development by Bay Area developers TMG Partners and Valley Oak Partners in the same general area that Google is eyeing for its potential campus.

Cupertino-based developer KT Urban submitted plans to the city in April for a new 19-story, 220-room glass-encased downtown hotel tower on what is currently a small downtown parking lot tucked next to the historic Hotel De Anza.

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe development that's planned alongside the Tamien station, a joint light rail and Caltrain stop, would include an estimated 568 residential units and 3,000 square feet of ground-floor retail, according to planning documents on file with the city of San Jose.

SAN JOSE  A big residential complex  including more than 100 affordable units is in the works for a choice central San Jose site next to a light rail station that is just a few stops away from the Diridon train hub where Google is planning a transit-oriented development.

The development alongside the Tamien station, a joint light rail and Caltrain stop, would include an estimated 568 residential units and 3,000 square feet of ground-floor retail, according to planning documents on file with the city of San Jose. Republic Urban and The Core Companies are the co-developers of the project.

The idea is to put market rate and affordable housing units right next to transit stations like Tamien, said Konstantin Voronin, land acquisition director with Republic Urban.

The ground-floor commercial space would likely be a child care center or the type of local-serving retail seen in a big residential project.

The entire development is 24 percent affordable and will contain a mix of 1-, 2- and 3-bedroom units, according toеКa presentation prepared by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, or VTA.

Of the 568 residences being planned, 433 units, or 76 percent of the total, would be market rate apartments, while 135, or 24 percent, would be offered as affordable domiciles, the VTA report stated.

The 135 units would be set aside for people in three categories of low-income households, using a complex formula derived from the U.S. Housing and Urban Development average median income in Santa Clara County of $125,200.

One-third of those would be set aside for people with household family incomes of roughly $68,860 a year, another third would be offered to households with a yearly income of approximately $53,200 and one-third would be available to people with an annual household income of about $40,690, according to a VTA presentation.

The site, located on Lick Avenue near Floyd Street and between Willow Street and West Alma Avenue, is a parking lot for the Tamien Station and also is the site of a Bright Horizons child care center. Republic Urban wanted to retain Bright Horizons as part of the new residential project, but the childrens facility decided to move to a nearby location.

The prospect of a major development boom in downtown San Jose  some of which is already underway  helped fuel the plans for the new residential project.

Google has proposed a transit-oriented community of offices, residences, shops, restaurants and open spaces near the Diridon train station, a development where 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giant's employees would eventually work.

San Jose-based Adobe Systems intends to build a new office tower next to its existing three-building downtown headquarters campus, marking a big expansion fueled by major employee growth.

You have Google coming in with 20,000 jobs, and we would be just down the line from Diridon Station, Voronin said.

Republic hopes that the seven-acre development fits the concept of a transit-oriented project that could help people live near their work, have access to a rail connection with links to other parts of the Bay Area such as San Francisco and the East Bay, and rely less on their cars.

We will try anything to get housing closer to transit, Voronin said. We want build to maximum allowable density based on the Tamien Area Specific Plan.",366,,26-Jul-18,"Nkf Capital Markets Completes Sale Of City View Plaza, San Jose's Premier",651,Financialwire,,"Nkf Capital Markets Completes Sale Of City View Plaza, San Jose's Premier

CityView Plaza, a block-sized mixed-use office and retail campus in downtown San Jose, has sold for a whopping $283.5 million to prolific San Francisco-based developer Jay Paul Co.

The property had been owned by Equus Capital Partners for more than a decade. Prior to the sale, Equus was also shepherding through city hall a proposal for a new 24-story residential and retail tower that could rise on the corner of the 11-acre property, a prospect that could increase the site's value to a savvy developer.

""Downtown San Jose is one of the only true urban submarkets in the Bay Area outside of San Francisco,"" Steven Golubchik, vice chairman at Newmark Knight Frank, said in a statement Wednesday. ""With one of the largest Caltrain stations and a BART line under development, Downtown San Jose will be one of the most easily accessible and interconnected locations in Northern California, making this a strategic investment.""

The deal works out to about $489 per square foot for the 579,541-square-foot property, which is roughly bounded by South Market Street, West San Fernando Street, Almaden Boulevard and Park Avenue. That includes both the office and retail space on the site, but not the 138,000-square-foot outdoor plaza and 1,071 parking stalls included in the deal.

The CityView complex today includes a mix of office buildings, a Paul Mitchell beauty school, about 40,000 square feet of retail, including restaurants like Specialty's Bakery & CafМ©, Scott's Seafood, Morton's Steakhouse and Peggy Sue's, as well as a ground-level Starbucks coffee shop.

The property is also outfitted with outdoor seating areas and a fountain. It sits blocks from downtown light rail stops and about a mile from the Diridon Caltrain and transit station.

Earlier this week, the Silicon Valley Business Journal first reported on the then-pending sale of the 11-acre property, which was expected to close at no less than $250 million and would be Jay Paul's only San Jose real estate holding. Sources with knowledge of the company's interest in the city say the company has also looked at other properties in the area.

But it seems CityView Plaza isn't a bad place to start for an investor in San Jose. When the property went on the market last April, it grabbed the attention of multiple big investors, according to Erik Hallgrimson, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield. Hallgrimson did not work on the CityView deal, but was aware of the buzz the property generated.

""It is a very unique opportunity to control virtually a whole block in downtown San Jose,"" he said in an interview last week.

The property sits about a block away from where Adobe Systems is planning to build a fourth office tower to add to its headquarters footprint and about a mile from where search engine giant Google has purchased dozens of properties for a campus that could span 6 million to 8 million square feet in size and bring up to 20,000 workers to the area.

Newmark Knight Frank's Golubchik, Executive Managing Director Edmund Najera and Senior Analyst David Hosler represented Equus. It was not immediately clear who represented Jay Paul, which tends to shy away from media exposure.

Prior to the sale, Equus had started on projects to update parts of the plaza, including an on-site fitness center, which is scheduled to re-open July 30, according to a recent notification sent out to plaza tenants, which include the Business Journal.

MSTRUCK-6383251 MSTRUCK",369,Liz Alderman,24-Jul-18,Portugal Bucked Austerity And...,1048,Canberra Times (australia),World; Pg. 12,"Portugal Bucked Austerity And...

Portugal bucked austerity and spent its way to recovery, writes Liz Alderman.

Lisbon: Ram&#xF3;n Rivera had barely started his olive oil business in the sun-swept Algarve region of Portugal when Europe's debt crisis struck. The economy crumbled, wages were cut, and unemployment doubled. The government had to accept a humiliating international bailout.

But as the misery deepened, Portugal took a daring stand: in 2015, it cast aside the austerity measures its European creditors had imposed, igniting a virtuous cycle that put its economy back on a path to growth. The country reversed cuts to wages, pensions and social security, and offered incentives to businesses.

The government's U-turn, and willingness to spend, had a powerful effect. Creditors railed against the move, but the gloom that had gripped the nation through years of belt-tightening began to lift. Business confidence rebounded. Production and exports began to take off - including at Rivera's olive groves.

""We had faith that Portugal would come out of the crisis,"" said Rivera, the general manager of Elaia. The company focused on state-of-the-art harvesting technology, and it is now one of Portugal's biggest olive oil producers. ""We saw that this was the best place in the world to invest.""

At a time of mounting uncertainty in Europe, Portugal has defied critics who have insisted on austerity as the answer to the Continent's economic and financial crisis. While countries from Greece to Ireland - and for a stretch, Portugal itself - toed the line, Lisbon resisted, helping to stoke a revival that drove economic growth last year to its highest level in a decade.

The renewal is visible just about everywhere. Hotels, restaurants and shops have opened in droves, fuelled by a tourism surge that has helped cut unemployment in half. In the Beato district of Lisbon, a mega-campus for startups rises from the rubble of a derelict military factory. Bosch, Google and Mercedes-Benz recently opened offices and digital research centres, employing thousands.

Foreign investment in aerospace, construction and other sectors is at a record high. And traditional Portuguese industries, including textiles and paper mills, are putting money into innovation, driving a boom in exports.

""What happened in Portugal shows that too much austerity deepens a recession, and creates a vicious circle,"" Prime Minister Ant&#xF3;nio Costa said. ""We devised an alternative to austerity, focusing on higher growth, and more and better jobs.""

Voters ushered Costa, a centre-left leader, into power in late 2015 after he promised to reverse cuts to their income, which the previous government had approved to reduce Portugal's high deficit under the terms of an international bailout of (EURO)78 billion ($123 billion). Costa formed an unusual alliance with Communist and radical-left parties, which had been shut out of power since the end of Portugal's dictatorship in 1974. They united with the goal of beating back austerity, while balancing the books to meet eurozone rules.

The government raised public sector salaries, the minimum wage and pensions and even restored the amount of vacation days to pre-bailout levels over objections from creditors like Germany and the International Monetary Fund. Incentives to stimulate business included development subsidies, tax credits and funding for small and midsize companies.

Costa made up for the give-backs with cuts in infrastructure and other spending, whittling the annual budget deficit to less than 1 per cent of its gross domestic product, compared with 4.4 per cent when he took office. The government is on track to achieve a surplus by 2020, a year ahead of schedule, ending a quarter-century of deficits.

European officials are now admitting that Portugal may have found a better response to the crisis. Recently, they rewarded Lisbon by elevating the country's finance minister, M&#xE1;rio Centeno, who helped engineer the changes, to president of the Eurogroup, the influential collective of eurozone finance ministers.

The economic about-face had a remarkable effect on Portugal's collective psyche. While discouragement lingers in Greece after a decade of cuts, Portugal's recovery has pivoted around restoring confidence to get people and businesses motivated again.

Yet Portugal's success is still vulnerable. Growth is cooling from 2.7 per cent last year, as Costa keeps public investment at a 40-year low to cut the deficit. While he restored public sector salaries to previous levels, they have barely budged since before the crisis. Social precariousness lingers, worsened by the spread of low-paying part-time contracts. And the minimum wage of (EURO)580 a month, although up, remains one of the lowest in the eurozone.

Portugal's unions are now threatening strikes to press the government to increase wages and unlock more public spending to reduce inequality.

Costa insists that the government must keep cutting the deficit to offset the biggest threat to Portugal: its enormous debt, still one of the eurozone's largest. Portuguese banks are saddled with bad loans from the earlier crisis, and the country remains vulnerable to any financial market turmoil that might be stirred up by problems in nearby Italy.

""We didn't go from the dark side to the bright side of the moon,"" he said. ""There's still a lot to do.""

To cement the growth cycle, the government is putting what little investment it makes into targeted initiatives like tax breaks for foreign companies and training for the unemployed.

An hour and a half east of Lisbon, in &#xC9;vora, a 2-hectare factory built by the French aeroplane-parts maker Mecachrome rises from rolling plains fringed with cork trees. Robots forge precision parts for Airbus, Boeing and other industry giants. Most of the 150 technicians were recruited nearby by an unemployment agency that started an intensive retraining program with the government.

Christian Santos, Mecachrome's director in Portugal, said he plans to hire 150 more workers and to make millions in additional investments in the next three years. ""Things are happening in Portugal,"" he said. ""There's an enthusiastic mojo here."" New York Times

HIGHLIGHT:еКCompany can't subsidize employee meals by more than half on a regular basis.

Seeking to support local businesses, Mountain View officials hit Facebook with a ban on a classic Silicon Valley techie perk: free meals.

Thats according to a new report on a little-discussed provision of Facebooks 2014 agreement with the city of Mountain View over offices it will occupy in the Village complex at San Antonio Center.

City officials mandated that companies located in the development cant regularly subsidize employee meals by more than 50 percent, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday.

It came in response to local restaurants that said Google, the city's biggest employer, was hurting their businesses by providing free meals, according to John McAlister, a Mountain View councilman, according to the Chronicle.

Facebook, which plans to open the Mountain View offices in the fall, can pay full meal costs for employees at restaurants open to the public, the Chronicle reported. The social media giant is, for now, the sole tenant in the complex.

Facebook can fully subsidize employees if they go to restaurants that are open to the public. City officials wanted to ensure the developmentеКdidn't have 400,000 square feet of office space with people that never left the building, Michael Kasperzak, a former Mountain View mayor who worked on the legislation, told the Chronicle.

CityView Plaza, a 600,437-square-foot downtown San Jose office plaza owned by Equus Capital Partners, is days away from getting a new owner, according to industry insiders with knowledge of the pending deal.

Jay Paul Co. is expected to close on the property this week, potentially as early as Tuesday, multiple people with knowledge of the negotiations have told the Silicon Valley Business Journal in the past week. The mixed-use plaza, located in the heart of booming downtown San Jose, would be Jay Paul's only holding in the city.

""It's really good news for downtown San Jose that a developer like Jay Paul would invest in an existing asset,"" Bob Staedler, principal at land use consultancy Silicon Valley Synergy said in an interview Monday afternoon. ""Jay's reputation is proven. This shows investors from afar that things are starting to take off.""

The prolific San Francisco-based developer is no stranger to Silicon Valley, however. The company has a large real estate portfolio occupied by some of the region's most prominent tech companies in flashy Peninsula cities like Sunnyvale, Mountain View and Palo Alto.

Its Moffett Park developments in Sunnyvale, for instance, have drawn a long list of tech giants to the city's business district. Among them: Amazon.com, Google and Microsoft Corp. Facebook also recently inked a more than 1 million-square-foot lease in the company's still-under-construction Moffett Towers II development.

Farther south, in the middle of Santa Cruz's downtown, Jay Paul also owns a mixed-use building where Amazon is quietly growing an office outpost working on its Alexa smart assistant and other technologies.

Representatives for Jay Paul did not respond to a request for comment on the rumored CityView Plaza sale last week. Equus did not immediately respond to an inquiry on Monday.

Pennsylvania-based Equus Capital Partners has owned CityView Plaza for more than a decade, after buying it from a limited liability company associated with San Francisco-based DivcoWest. The investment firm is currently making improvements around the property, including updates to the on-site gym and in the lobby of the building at 125 S. Market St., where the Silicon Valley Business Journal leases space.

Edmund Najera and Steve Golubchik of Newmark Knight Frank have been marketing the 11-acre plaza on behalf of Equus Capital Partners since April. Representatives for the group declined to comment for this story, but other industry insiders say the downtown San Jose property piqued the interest of multiple big players in the market.

""The CityView marketing process got a ton of investor interest and it is a very unique opportunity to control virtually a whole block in downtown San Jose,"" Erik Hallgrimson, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield, said in an interview Friday.

When the site, originally built in the 1970s, went on the market earlier this year, industry insiders estimated it would attract bids upwards of $250 million, which would work out to $416 per square foot at a minimum.

The per-square-foot record in downtown San Jose is currently $544.31 per square foot, which Foster City-based Steelwave fetched on one of two buildings at Riverpark Towers when a joint venture made up of DivcoWest and Rockpoint Group bought the complex late last year.

Earlier in 2017, the record price had been set at $509 per square foot when AEW Capital purchased the Class A office building at 303 Almaden Blvd from Rockwood Capital for $80.15 million.

CityView sits near both Riverpark Towers and 303 Almaden, in the heart of San Jose's downtown. The property is mere blocks from where Adobe Systems is slated to expand its office footprint with a new tower, and less than a mile from where search giant Google is dreaming up a massive new mixed-use campus flush with offices, retail and new residential units.

The CityView complex today includes a mix of office buildings, a Paul Mitchell beauty school, about 40,000 square feet of retail, including restaurants like Specialty's Bakery & CafМ©, Scott's Seafood, Morton's Steakhouse and Peggy Sue's, as well as a ground-level Starbucks coffee shop.

The property is also outfitted with outdoor seating areas and a fountain. It sits blocks from downtown light rail stops and about a mile from the Diridon Caltrain and transit station.

Equus is currently working on getting entitlements for an additional 24-story, 260-unit mixed-use tower on the site, an approval that could make the property even more valuable to a savvy developer like Jay Paul.

If ultimately approved, the 24-story tower at the corner of Park Avenue and Almaden Boulevard would be the first residential project built along the Almaden Boulevard corridor, and would rise in place of the stout, but distinctive, former Santa Clara County Superior Court building.

As of March this year, CityView was about 92 percent leased, much of which was below market rates. Even so, the team at Colliers International that has been working to lease the space in the development for more than a decade say it has been a strong asset.

""It has performed very well in every real estate cycle that I've work on it in the last 13 years,"" Dion Campisi, senior vice president for Colliers International, told the Business Journal in an interview earlier this year, though he declined to comment on the potential sale of the property.

HIGHLIGHT:еКFive office buildings, including TiVo's headquarters, tucked away on Gold Street in San Jose's Alviso village, have been bought by SFF Realty Fund, an affiliate of San Francisco-based PSAI Realty Partners, a property investment firm, for $91.5 million in cash.

SAN JOSE  Five office buildings  including the Tivo headquarters complex  near the Guadalupe River have been bought in a deal that appears to point to a surge of activity in north San Jose.

The five buildings, tucked away on the 2100 block of Gold Street in San Joses Alviso village, were purchased by SFF Realty Fund, an affiliate of San Francisco-based PSAI Realty Partners, a property investment firm.

SFF Realty Fund paid $91.5 million in cash on July 19 in a deal for a campus whose tenants include TiVo, a high-profile entertainment technology company, according to Santa Clara County property documents.

The sale was arranged through brokers Steven Golubchik, Grant Lammersen and Edmund Najera, all executives with NKF Capital Markets, a commercial realty brokerage that specializes in property purchases. CBRE, a commercial realty brokerage, is seeking tenants for spaces in the office complex, known as Gold Street Technology Center, which is located just north of State Route 237.

The Alviso area of San Jose has had a stigma in the past for investors and tenants, but now it is getting a lot more interest and activity, said Dave Sandlin, a senior vice president and principal executive with Colliers International, a commercial realty brokerage.

The seller of the 303,000-square-foot office complex was ECI Four Gold Street, an affiliate of Belmont-based Embarcadero Capital Partners, county documents show.

A growing number of tech companies has demonstrated rising interest in sections of San Jose that are north of Highway 237.

In September 2017, Microsoft paid $73.2 million for 65 acres of farmland fronting on Highway 237 and the Coyote Rivers banks.

In January, Google paid $117.3 million for three huge industrial buildings that together total 563,000 square feet, and all are on Disk Drive.

Google could be buying even more buildings in this area. Thats the rumor, Sandlin said.

In March, Hewlett Packard Enterprise disclosed plans to move its headquarters to theеКAmerica Center campus, leasing 220,000 square feet at 6280 America Center Drive in San Jose.

HIGHLIGHT:еКThe most recent deal for WeWork marks a major company milestone: It's the first time the provider of shared office space and services has passed the one-million-square-foot mark in total Bay Area office space.

SAN MATEO  WeWork has extended its Bay Area expansion by leasing a four-story office building in San Mateo where up to 1,650 people could work, the company said Tuesday.

The company agreed to lease up to four floors in an office building at 400 Concar Drive in San Mateo that was developed by Hines, a realty firm.

This most recent deal marks a major milestone for WeWork: Its the first time the provider of shared office space and services has passed the one-million-square-foot mark in total Bay Area office space.

Its also the first time WeWork has occupied a site in San Mateo County.

WeWork members all over the Bay Area have been asking for a location in San Mateo, saidеКElton Kwok, general manager, Northern California at WeWork.

A WeWork member typically is a company or other organization that takes space in one of WeWorks locations.еКThe company serves roughly 14,500 members in the Bay Area.

Including the new Peninsula location, WeWork has struck deals to occupy locations in seven different Bay Area cities.

WeWork is already in San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley. The quickly expanding company also has announced leasing deals for offices in Mountain View, Mill Valley and now, San Mateo.

The four-story San Mateo office building WeWork leased totals 96,000 square feet, according to Hines. Throughout the Bay Area prior to the San Mateo transaction, WeWork had leased nearly 981,000 square feet of offices.

The new WeWork San Mateo location will be able to accommodate 1,650 desks, the company said.

Were thrilled to finally be able to service the Peninsula with our very first San Mateo location and meet the big demand in this booming community, Kwok said.

In Silicon Valley, the East Bay and San Francisco, tech titans including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon have bought or leased properties in an unprecedented expansion fueled by a hiring boom at these companies.

Yet the growth spurt also has filled big office buildings and planned campuses that havent yet been built. The quest for elbow room has made it tougher for medium- and small-sized companies to find sites for their own operations.

The WeWork business model can make it possible for companies of all sizes to find shared workspaces for their operations.

Among the high-profile members of WeWork in the Bay Area: Amazons Lab 126 has moved into a downtown San Jose office tower at the corner of East Santa Clara and North Second streets, and Facebook has agreed to take big blocks of space in Mountain View on San Antonio Road.

Worldwide, other big companies that have become WeWork members includeеКGeneral Electric, HSBC, Salesforce, Microsoft, RBC, Mastercard, Samsung, Spotify, Silicon Valley Bank, Nasdaq, Sprint, KPMG, Liberty Mutual, Lululemon, Pinterest, Red Bull, Bacardi, General Motors and Starbucks.

WeWork provides more than 253,000 members around the world with space, community, and services through both physical and digital offerings, the company said.

HIGHLIGHT:еКAir China has been offering up to three flights a week between the South Bay and China, but the air carrier is preparing to end its services after Sept. 25 until further notice.

SAN JOSE  Air China has decided to slash flights between Mineta San Jose International Airport and Shanghai, a decision that comes despite the airports big increases in passenger activity.

The air carrier is preparing to halt service on the route after Sept. 25, according to the airline and airport officials.

Air China is discontinuing its San Jose-Shanghai nonstop flight effectiveеКSept. 25, 2018, until further notice, the air carrier stated.

The flights operated by Air China began in 2016.

The reduced number of aircraft available arising from the maintenance of its Dreamliner fleet was the primary reason Air China offered for its abrupt cancellation of the service.

Air China has been offering up to three flights a week between the South Bay and China, said Rosemary Barnes, a spokeswoman for Mineta San Jose International Airport.

The airline notified us that they will discontinue this service for the foreseeable future, Barnes said.

Despite this sharp cutback in service, San Jose air travelers will still have access to flights between Silicon Valley and China.

Hainan AirlinesеКoffers up to five weekly nonstop flights to Beijing, Barnes said.

The Air China cutbacks occur at a time when air travel in Silicon Valley has been buoyed by a Bay Area and nationwide economic boom. In recent months and years, tech giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Adobe Systems and Amazon have carried out or prepared huge expansions in their operations, fueled by rising business demand and big increases in hiring.

As a result, passengers have flocked to San Jose airport.

During 2017, passenger traffic at San Jose increased 15.6 percent, marking five straight years of passenger growth. San Jose airport served 12.48 million departing and arriving passengers in 2017.

Aeromexico and Frontier began serving San Jose airport for the first time last year. New routes introduced by other air carriers include: Guadalajara, Morelia and Zacatecas in Mexico; Newark, New Jersey; Chicago-OHare; Austin, Texas; Reno; and the Southern California cities of Long Beach and Burbank.

Facebook, Inc. is bringing nonprofit Year Up's training team to its Menlo Park headquarters, guaranteeing internships and potential full-time employment to local young adults who go through its program.

Facebook will train 80 local young adults in its first year, through Year Up, a nonprofit workforce development program, giving preference to residents of nearby North Fair Oaks, East Palo Alto, Redwood City and Belle Haven. It will begin training 40 students this fall for a six-month internship with hopes to train 240 over the next three years.

""As we grow in Menlo Park, it is increasingly important to hire strong, local talent and create opportunities for our neighbors,"" Bernita Dillard, Facebook public policy associate manager for local recruitment, told the Business Journal in an interview Monday. ""We've hosted and hired their [Year Up] interns here so with this new partnership, it's easy for our community members to just walk to [it].""

The new program comes as the social network, which plans to open new campuses in Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Fremont and downtown San Francisco - in addition to doubling its workforce in Menlo Park to 35,000 in coming years -еКfaces pressure from nearby communities who claim the company's growth is exacerbating a rise in housing prices and displacing existing residents.

The partnership also comes as Facebook competes against other tech giants for diverse talent.еКYear Up Bay Area has focused on boosting minority students: 37 percent of its students are Hispanic or Latino, and 22 percent are Black/African American. On average, students are between the ages of 18 and 24 and don't have college degrees.

The ""deepened partnership"" is one of two recent programs rolled out as a part of Facebook's local job effort, called Access, Dillard said. Since the program was launched last fall, the company came out with a monthly professional development workshop that offers resume and interviewing skills training. Access also has a job site specifically for nearby residents who may want to apply at Facebook or its vendors.

Year Up has partnerships with major Silicon Valley employers including Alphabet Inc-owned Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft Corp., Electronic Arts and PayPal Holdings.

By having a Year Up location on its campus, Facebook will get direct access to the students that come out of the program. By having a Year Up location on its campus, Facebook will get direct access to the students that come out of the program, while acting as a venue for youth who can't make it to one of the nonprofit's two existing locations in San Francisco and downtown San Jose.

Dillard said students will be trained in project management and go into internships as recruiting coordinators or they'll be trained as IT professionals and go into IT administrator internships. ""We have a lot of roles in that particular area [IT] and the recruiting coordinator role really aligned well with their (Year Up's) project management curriculum.""

Dillard, who was born and raised in East Palo Alto, said she was a ""big fan"" of Year Up prior to joining Facebook. ""Coming into the role, I was extremely excited that we already had a partnership [with Year Up] and I thought, 'Wow they have an office in San Francisco and an office in San Jose.. how can we bring this initiative to people here in East Palo Alto, Belle Haven and North Fair Oaks?' So, I pitched the idea of creating a learning center on our campus and everyone seemed to love it.""

Facebook, which has worked with Year Up since 2011, will fund the organization's year-long program that includes its curriculum, instructors, stipends, and bus fares for students in need. Facebook said it will likely continue to recruit from Year Up's two other Bay Area locations but that it will be focused on the talent coming from Menlo Park.

By having Year Up on-site, there's room to stretch the program in the future, Dillard said. ""Hopefully, we will grow and expand but right now, we're focused on building the program and ensuring its success as it is now.""
