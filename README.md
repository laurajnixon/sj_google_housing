A project to explore how coverage of the new San Jose Google campus was impacted by the release of a report in July 2019 estimating the impact on rents in Silicon Valley.

    Was the release of the report associated with increased discussion of rent increases and displacement?

    What kinds of topics/language appeared in articles during the month the report was published, and how does that compare to previous coverage?
