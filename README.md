A project to explore how coverage of the new San Jose Google campus was impacted by the release of a report in July 2019 estimating the impact on rents in Silicon Valley.

- Was the release of the report associated with increased discussion of rent increases and displacement?

- What kinds of topics/language appeared in articles during the month the report was published, and how does that compare to previous coverage?
